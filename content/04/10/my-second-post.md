Seems like I should have something profound for the first blog entries, and I can't think of anything. Oh well, I guess I can just jump right in to normal life and after a few days it won't seem awkward because it'll be past.  
  
Talked to Lydia last night for the first time in probably 8 years. Haven't seen her in probably 15 years. It was good to talk to her. Heard her voice to from sad to happy in about 2 seconds, which was really nice. We've fortunately managed to avoid that awkwardness that comes from having a very different relationship 10 years ago; I think we're going to be fine with the fact that we've moved on, that I'm married with a kid now and she's living her own life. It's so cool... really kinda fun to have a friend from that long ago.  
  
Took a long walk last night on a beautiful, soggy night outside. Makes me wish I lived in Seattle or Scotland or something. But here I am in Iowa. :-)
