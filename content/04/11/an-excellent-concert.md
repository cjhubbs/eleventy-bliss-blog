Went with my brother Ryan to a [Caedmon's Call](http://www.caedmonscall.com) concert Friday night at [Judson College](http://www.judsoncollege.edu) in Elgin, IL. It was my first time seeing Caedmon's in person; they've been a favorite of mine via CD for 5 or so years now. They totally met (if did not exceed) expectations. The band rocked, they played a lot of good songs, they came off as much more real than most performers do. You get the feeling they're just a group of folks that like to play and sing music, and they're letting us in on a jam session.  
  
I really only had two wishes unfulfilled at the end of the night; the first was that I didn't get to meet [Andy Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com), the new lead guitar player (and sometime lead singer) for the band. I think he was visiting with his family after the show, didn't participate in the meet and greet. The second wish really only developed during the show: I wish I would've had a chance to see them when [Derek Webb](http://www.derekwebb.com) was still a member of the band. His songs are such an integral part of their repertoire, and his voice and presence such a crucial part of their sound... and that's not a knock on Andy O., that's just the way it is. Oh well, it was still a great concert. They stay at the top of my favorite groups list.
