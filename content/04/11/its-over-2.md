To quote [John Derbyshire](http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire200411030232.asp), _YEEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAAAA!_  
  
The election is over. Kerry conceded without putting up a big fight. No big lawsuits. No big charges of voting fraud. Tom Daschle got beat in South Dakota. (My respect for South Dakotans just went up by a couple orders of magnitude.) The Republicans picked up more seats in the Senate and the House. Things look like they might just calm down politically for a while... at least until some seats on the Supreme Court open up, then they'll be back to the old tricks.  
  
I stayed up until almost midnight CST last night watching Fox News. I was annoyed a bit with Fox since they hardly interviewed anybody, just stuck with their base 4 commentators all night. However, it beat the pants off of the NBC/ABC/CBS/MSNBC coverage, hosted by Mr "I'm Retiring Now" Brokaw, Mr. "I'm a smug Canadian" Jennings, Mr. "Send me a forged document" Rather, and Mr. "I used to work for Tip O'Neill" Matthews. When they finally called Ohio for Bush, I decided it was over and time for bed. When I woke up this morning and turned Fox back on, it was funny to see the electoral vote count exactly where it was when I went to sleep 6 hours previous... Tonight I shall sleep the sleep of the righteous... totally at peace with the world. :-)  
  
I would be much remiss if I didn't at least mention a nice [statistical analysis](http://ijsm.org/archives/2004/11/03/numbers-game/) that a guy I'm familiar with (he runs the Caedmon's Call fan website) posted on his blog last night in the middle of the Ohio discussion... way to go, Geof!
