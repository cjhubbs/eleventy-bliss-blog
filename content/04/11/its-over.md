To quote [John Derbyshire](http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire200411030232.asp), _YEEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAAAA!_

The election is over. Kerry conceded without putting up a big fight. No big lawsuits. No big charges of voting fraud. Tom Daschle got beat in South Dakota. (My respect for South Dakotans just went up by a couple orders of magnitude.) The Republicans picked up more seats in the Senate and the House. Things look like they might just calm down politically for a while... at least until some seats on the Supreme Court open up, then they'll be back to the old tricks.

I would be much remiss if I didn't at least mention a nice [statistical analysis](http://ijsm.org/archives/2004/11/03/numbers-game/) that a guy I'm familiar with (he runs the Caedmon's Call fan website) posted on his blog last night in the middle of the Ohio discussion... way to go, Geof!
