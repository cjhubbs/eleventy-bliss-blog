This morning we are experiencing one of those fun office moments known as "network downtime". Nobody can get logged in and even if you can (I managed somehow), nothing works; all of the network drives are dead. Fortunately, Internet access still works, so I can post a little blog like this one.

It's interesting listening to the buzz around here; people are talking where normally there is only silence and people working. I doubt anybody's gotten anything done all morning, so right now I'm going on 2+ hours of downtime. Take that times 4000 people or so at RC and at the billing rate that engineers cost, and we're up to almost $1Million in general time while we're all waiting for the network.

I should really find something more interesting to blog about; I've seen some people with long, thoughtful posts; however, I guess I don't find the time for long, thoughtful writing. I mean, I can when I need to or want to, but I guess I spend so much time of each day just getting work and normal stuff done that I don't take a lot of time to just sit and think and write. It's really too bad; I do have actual thoughts about stuff on a semi-regular basis.
