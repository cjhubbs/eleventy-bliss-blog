It's a weird thing to get older; and then in a way it's the most natural thing we ever do, since we're all doing it all the time. The latest realization of this was when I ran across my little sister's blog (see link to the right).

Rebecca is 10 years younger than me; I remember her primarily as the little girl, as a preschooler and elementary-schooler. I left home for college when she was not quite 8, so my memories of her after that are fewer and farther between. She's now 17. Where has time gone? It's so strange to read her posts where she does all the normal teenage-girl-type things, agonizing over boys (mostly asking why are they so awful, and why are none of them like her awesome brother (not me, though I wish it were :-))) and quoting lyrics from angsty (is that a word?) songs. Come to think of it, I was a lot that way when I was a teenager...

Part of me feels better when I remember that she's going through the normal teenage stuff, and that she will get past it, and will have a great life. The other part of me wans to just be protective and make things all work out for her, which I know I can't. Arrrgh. All I can do is hope and pray that she makes the right decisions (she's doing a good job so far) and that God works things out. I know He has good plans, but it's hard to trust.

I haven't told her yet that I'm reading her blog; I don't know if she'll be OK with it or if she'll be mortified that her older brother is reading the same stuff that her friends are. I'll promise not to be peeved that when she was writing her eternal post (she had a contest with a friend for the longest post, and she won) she mentioned her other three brothers, but not me... :-) Well at some point I guess I'll tell her. Maybe it'll help us communicate better. Maybe I can even give her a link to mine....
