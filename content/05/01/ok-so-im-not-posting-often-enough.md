Or so my sister tells me. Of course, she's 17, a senior in highschool, and has the time to keep up her blog. But the least I can do is actually give it a shot. Don't know how interesting it'll be, but I'll give it a try. This will probably be more informational than thoughtful, but if info's what you're after, then you're all set.  
  
I watched a couple interesting high-school movies the other night: the recent [Napoleon Dynamite](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/), and then [Ghost World](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0162346/), which is 4 or 5 years old. Napoleon Dynamite is a hit among some of my friends, and I wasn't sure what I'd think of it. I laughed at parts, and was generally amused by the whole thing. It's one of those films thatmy wife just rolls her eyes at ("that's two hours I'm never getting back") but I enjoyed the pastique of the high school life. It certainly sums up the experience of being a loser in high school. And I just have to have appreciation for a movie where basically no one is a decent actor in the whole movie, and that's almost the point; the guys just have blank-faced stares the whole time. Am I rambling here? Have I made any sense? I dunno. Yep, that's pretty much the movie.  
  
Ghost World was different. It was snappy, incisive, and incredibly profane. But at the same time it painted a good picture of two girls headed different directions in life, and their search for life after high school. While the language/dialog probably prevents me from recommending this to everyone, I really enjoyed it.  
  
I don't know why the sudden interest in high school movies; I was home schooled and never went to high school. I guess I'm reverting back 10 years for a little while. :-)  
  
So that's the interesting news from my life today. Now it's back to work.
