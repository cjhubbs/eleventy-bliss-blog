So I got an iPod for Christmas... and of course the next task is ripping all of my CDs to mp3s so I can put them on the iPod. That was a task in itself. I'm almost done... (done with all the popular music, about halfway through the classical.) So then I got curious and started wondering about converting all the cassette tapes that I've got... (there's not as many as the CDs, only probably a dozen that I'd care about converting, but still...)  
  
So I researched it a bit online and figured out that by running a cable from the headphone jack of my tape deck into the line in input of my PC, I can record those old tapes. And the free dBPowerAmp software is really slick for recording them; it will automagically sense dead time between songs and split it out into separate mp3 files... too cool. So, now that the geek in me was satisfied with my use of technology, I could get on to recording all of my high school tapes. And that was the scary part.  
  
I was a big Michael W. Smith fan in high school. So of course some of the first tapes to get converted were his albums The Big Picture, Go West Young Man, Change Your World, and The Live Set. (To be fair, a couple of those were done when I was middle-school-aged... and I just picked them up in high school. :-)) And then there were a couple old Amy Grant albums, and Michael English's two good albums that he released before his confession-of-an-affair-and-returning-all-his-Dove-awards debacle. And an old Steven Curtis Chapman album or two.  
  
If you're reading this and recognize all these names, then you'll also recognize that my musical scope was a bit limited in high school; my folks were pretty adamant that Christian music was the only choice (although jazz and classical were also OK), and I was remarkably content with that. The downside is that now as an adult I feel like I missed a few things... but that also makes for neat discoveries. I got the 2-CD set The Essential Bob Dylan this weekend and I'm enjoying it immensely. Probably wouldn't have appreciated it when I was 17. 
  
What a difference a decade makes.
