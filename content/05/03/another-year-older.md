Has it really been 3 weeks since I've posted? Good grief! No wonder nobody reads my blog...

Well, we'll make this a general information-type post and maybe it'll be easier to write. :-)

Yesterday was my 28th birthday. Didn't do much very exciting; work all day and then meetings at church until 8:00 last night. We're going to go out for dinner tonight, so we're not avoiding partying, we're just delaying it.

Becky got me a Kyser Partial Capo (which I've been thinking about buying for months and never have...) so I'm really excited about that. Maybe this afternoon I can head home and try it out. I've seen other people use them to great effect in performances, and I'm hoping I can do the same. She also got me one of those plug-it-right-into-your-TV video game things, it has Pac Man, DigDug, and Galaxian. I do so love the retro games.

So all in all it wasn't a bad birthday. Birthdays, as a whole, change in tone as you get older. When you're a kid, you look forward to it for weeks, it's the most exciting day of the year (save Christmas), it's a huge deal. Now at 28, my birthday was really just another day. And that's OK with me. It is fun to have an excuse to go out for dinner and maybe buy something I've been drooling over for a while... but then I can do that other days, too. So that's my ho-hum attitude this March the 15th. Don't think I'm complaining... I'm just learning to recognize the joys of every day.
