A book by this title was given to my by my pastor last week; we are "kindred readers" with an affinity for Eugene Peterson's practical written wisdom. I got no further than the introduction last night. This was partly due to my early morning and long day; but moreso due to my captivation with the poem from which the title came. It is an untitled sonnet written by Gerard Manley Hopkins, a 19th century poet and priest.

> _As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame; As tumbled over rim in roundy wells Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name; Each mortal thing does one thing and the same: Deals out that being indoors each one dwells; Selves -- goes itself; myself it speaks and spells, Crying What I do is me: for that I came.
> 
> I say more: the just man justices; Keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces; Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is -- Christ. For Christ plays in ten thousand places, Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his To the Father through the features of men's faces._

This poem intrigues and delights me in ways I haven't yet been able to describe very well. But I think that it captures the essence of living out our lives in the Spirit every day. Christ "plays" throughout each of us as we live in Him. I am challenged this morning to meditate on Christ, and see how He might play out even more through my life.

I'll try to provide updates as I work my way through Peterson's book.
