I know I owe everybody a blog post (it's been a couple days... time to keep writing) but it's been pretty slow around here lately. My latest task at work has been to manually compare two 200-ish-page documents and mark all the changes. (At this point, the geeks reading this are asking "why manually diff it when you could use a tool?" The answer is, I'm looking for functional differences, not trivial wording differences. Ugh.) I finally finished that up this morning but my eyes are a little bleary now and I know more about this next new airplane than I really wanted to.

I did some fun website stuff last night for my [RecMinUsa](http://recminusa.org) site... my pastor (who runs RecMinUsa) wants to be able to update the "upcoming events" page without having to look at HTML. So, I created a formatted text file that he can update, and then a perl script to post-process the text file and merge it with an HTML template to create the page. It seems to work OK... hopefully I kept it simple enough. :-)

I read some more of Peterson's _Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places_ last night. I'm to the point in the book where he's talking about how Christ "plays" in community. I'm still organizing my thoughts on the topic, but it's good stuff. I'll have to devote a post to it when I get the time to think.

Well that's the 8:45 news from Iowa... kind of boring, huh? Sorry. Come back again, it'll be more interesting next time. I promise.
