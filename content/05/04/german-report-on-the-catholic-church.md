I just couldn't resist posting this... it was too funny. Credit to James Taranto at [Best of the Web Today](http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110006544).

_"More than three-quarters of Germans want the successor of Pope John Paul II to be less 'rigid' about sexual morality and end the Church's ban on contraception, according to a poll published Saturday," Deutsche Welle reports:_

> About 78 percent of those surveyed said they were in favor of the Catholic Church ending its ban on contraception, and 76 percent wanted the next pope to authorize the use of condoms as part of the fight against the spread of AIDS, the poll said.
> 
> In addition, 77 percent of respondents said they wanted to see the ordination of women as priests and 74 percent think that imposing celibacy and chastity on priests is no longer expedient.

_So, the Germans think the Roman Catholic Church is too conservative? Isn't DW about 487 years late on this story? Coming next: Germany's low-carb weight-loss craze, the Diet of Worms!_
