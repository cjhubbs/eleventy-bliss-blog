I've made the switch today from my old blogger.com blog to my new rmfo-blogs.com blog. Don't get too confused; this blog hasn't really been here since back in December. I just copied some of my old blogger entries over here to give this one a nice "lived-in" feel. :-)

I will do my best to keep this updated. If you read this, post a comment so I know it's being read! And remind me if I haven't updated in a while...
