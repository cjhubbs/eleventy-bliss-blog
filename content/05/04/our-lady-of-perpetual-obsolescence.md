A friend e-mailed me this link today: [Our Lady of Perpetual Obsolescence Vinyl Rescue Mission and Orphanage - Severely Religious Wing](http://www.vinylorphanage.com/religious.html). _(Note to the wise: some of the other pages on the site are R-rated and worth avoiding.)_ There are some pretty funny album covers from old Religious records - worth laughing at for a minute or two when you have the time.
