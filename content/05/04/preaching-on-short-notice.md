It had been planned for about a month that I would fill the pulpit at [my church](http://www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org) on April 24th. Then about a week ago I got asked if I could switch to the 17th, to fill in for our youth pastor who has been sick. So, on short notice, I think it turned out OK. You can listen to the second half of the sermon [here](http://www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org/20050417.ram)... apparently the audio guys only managed to record half of it. Arrrgh.

The topic of the sermon is "Three Characteristics of a Loving Follower", from Ephesians 5:1-2. It's not super-exciting, but one of my better efforts (of which only total 3, so I'm relatively inexperienced here). And that's your little insight into Chris's life for today. :-)
