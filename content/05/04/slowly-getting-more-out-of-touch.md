I have this "movies I've watched recently" link section on the side of the blog. I intended to list movies that I saw in the theater or on DVD. If you're a regular reader, you will have noted that it hasn't changed in quite some time.

I noted a progression yesterday while talking with Becky. We were thinking of renting Meet The Fockers, but decided to just watch something recorded on the Tivo instead. The progression goes something like this:

- Back before we had Laura we'd go watch movies in the theater.
- Once Laura was born, we'd wait until they came out on DVD.
- Now that we got our Tivo, we'll end up waiting until the movie gets shown on TV. :-)

I will have to break this chain for some movies; obviously when the new [Star Wars](http://www.starwars.com) movie comes out I'll be watching it in the theater. But as a whole, I feel myself slipping more and more into behind-the-times oblivion, at least as far as pop culture goes. Oh well. It's not always bad to be out of touch. :-)
