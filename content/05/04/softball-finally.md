We had our first softball practice of the season last night. It was a beautiful night to be out, and fun to put the glove back on and play some catch. That being said, I was terrible! I couldn't hit the ball to save my life. Now, I've never been a good hitter, but this was ridiculous. Becky was smacking the ball around such that I, in comparison, looked like a little weenie. :-)

Well, that's my embarrassed rant for this morning. It was still a great time. Hopefully I'll come up with something more substantive to post later on.
