I starting reading some of the other [rmfo blogs](http://rmfo-blogs.com/about) and found [David's post](http://rmfo-blogs.com/david/archives/2005/04/13/this-week-in-softball/) on softball. I'm quite jealous that his season has already started; mine doesn't start for a couple weeks yet. I'm looking forward to it hugely. Actually, I should call it "our" season... Becky and I play on a co-ed church league team. She's the die-hard softball player (played in high school), I'm the recreational player.

This will be the first season that we'll have a little kiddo on the bench to take care of - Laura was born right at the end of last softball season. It's already been determined that I will be the one in charge of child care if somebody needs to sit with her during a game. Hey, I volunteered. I figure Becky missed almost all of last year (except for some heroics in the last game of the season... but that's another story) since she was pregnant so it's the least I can do. :-)

Well this is kind of a boring post but I'm trying to figure out trackbacks and add some traffic to the new blog, so that's what you get for the day.
