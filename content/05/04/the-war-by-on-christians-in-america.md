Stanley Kurtz has [an excellent (if a bit long) column today](http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200504280758.asp) discussing the current edition of _[Harper's Magazine](http://www.harpers.org/index.html)_ - cover story: "The Christian Right's War on America".

He argues that by accusing the "Christian Right" of being hateful and "at war with America", _Harper's_ (as just one participant in a trend by the media) is themselves promoting "hatred" of a group... the Christian Right. He writes:

> According to _Harper’s_, conservative Christians are making “war on America.” Can you imagine the reaction to a cover story about a “war on America” by blacks, gays, Hispanics, or Jews?

It's worth reading the whole article.
