OK, so it's Friday afternoon, and I'm bored. I've hit the end of the task list for work today, and nobody else has updated their blogs to give me something to read... so I post this whiny entry with the knowledge that in 30 minutes my weekend will begin. I guess I'll make it. :-)

Tonight we're going to our favorite coffeehouse, [_Brewed Awakenings_](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com) to hear a friend perform. He's a heck of a singer, doesn't do any originals, but covers everybody from Dylan and the Beatles to John Denver to James Taylor to Crash Test Dummies... good times.

Then Saturday will be a work day at home, maybe I'll get done [last weekend's projects](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/04/22/projects/)... then Sunday is typical church stuff, and the Monday starts the softball season! I've been [looking forward to it](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/04/13/softball/) for weeks. Sounds like it'll be chilly for the first game (in the 50's) but that just makes it more fun.

Well that's all for now... have a great weekend!
