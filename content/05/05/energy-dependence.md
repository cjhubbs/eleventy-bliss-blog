Another day, another NRO column to comment on. Today it's [Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren arguing on the "myths" of energy independence](http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/taylor_200505040803.asp). They have some interesting views on the subject, noting that:

1. it's a global marketplace, so the amount of oil we import vs the amount of oil we produce doesn't affect the price - only the global quantity on the market affects the price

and,

2. it wouldn't be wise to totally cut ourselves off from the foriegn oil market, because a limited domestic production is easier for terrorists to strike than a distributed (global) production.

Now, they're good libertarians from the [Cato Institute](http://www.cato.org), so their answer is to quit subsidizing the fuel situation, and just let the free market play itself out. I'm not so sure I agree with this; part of me would like to see a "Manhattan Project"-style effort to develop a usable alternative fuel system. But their comments about the global oil market make the article worth a read.
