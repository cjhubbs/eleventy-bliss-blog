...any musician. One of the downsides of being the music leader at a small church is that it's hard to find a replacement when you're going to be gone. I have a couple people who are on the usual list to back me up... one guitarist and one pianist. Usually at least one of them will be available. Well, I'm out of town this weekend for my sister's graduation. The guitarist is also out of town this weekend. The pianist is watching 4 of her grandkids all weekend and doesn't have the time she needs to practice. Our bass player who might be able to fill in on guitar in a pinch is also out of town. I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do... they may be singing _a capella_ on Sunday.

There's one other possibility that someone mentioned - a recent attender who is rumored to be a piano teacher. However, I've never talked to her about playing for a service, and I'm not sure of her skill level, (or even if she's actually a piano teacher). So, I'm fairly uncomfortable making a phone call that will go something like this: "Hi, I'm Chris from Noelridge, remember me? I know you haven't been to church in a couple weeks, but I heard a rumor you might be a piano teacher and so I'm wondering if you'd like to play the piano for church this week and by the way practice is tomorrow night..." Not a real good option in my book. Well, it'll work out somehow. I _will_ get out of town this weekend.
