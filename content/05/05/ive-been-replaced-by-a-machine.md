At least for Sunday, that is... I was unable to wrangle up a musician for the Sunday service, so my next option is to record my piano-playing on the electronic keyboard, so they can just play it back on Sunday. How lame is that? (I am humongously opposed to using recorded music in a church service, pretty much just because it can cause so much trouble for anyone who loses their place, it seems artificial, etc. Live accompaniment is always better.) Anyhow, it's a nice Roland keyboard with a disk drive built in, so I'll be recording the tracks and then they can play them back live... it's at least better than recording on audio tape and playing it back. :-)

I'm sure it'll end up uncoordinated and kind of lame on Sunday, but unfortunately I can't really help that. We need more musicians!
