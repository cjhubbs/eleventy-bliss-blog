OK, I'm excited. I just finished talking to my brother [Andrew](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hubbs86). He is almost 19, has been playing on the worship team at his church (Richland Center Fellowship, Richland Center, Wisconsin) for a while now, and has the opportunity to lead the worship service in a couple weeks... on the Sunday that the rest of the family is going to be visiting!

We have a musical family. Dad was a music education major, Mom minored in voice, and all of us 5 kids play at least 1 instrument, some of us several. We did occasional special music and such growing up, and I really miss the chances to do stuff with them. We know so much of the same music that it's ridiculous.

Quick picture to paint: we're all home at Christmastime, and I'm sitting in the living room just goofing around on my guitar with [Caedmon's Call's](http://caedmonscall.com) _[Hands of the Potter](http://caedmonscall.net/songs/bh/track04.php)_. My brother Aaron (age 21) is working on installing a cat door in the porch door, I didn't even think he's paying attention, and as I get to the chorus, he just kicks in singing the backup part. It was way too cool.

Anyhow, Aaron is off in Panama doing missions, but Ryan (age 25) and Andrew and I will all be around on that Sunday, and the plan is that we will all help out with the worship time, playing and singing. This is exciting for multiple reasons; first, to get to play music with those guys again is a treat. Second, I'm the worship leader of a church of 150 or so rather subdued worshippers (God's "frozen chosen" :-)). We'll be leading at a church of 400 or so more energetic types. Thirdly (and maybe this should be first, priority-wise), I get to help encourage Andrew in his quest to head down a similar path as I've gone down, to use his musical talents as a worship leader. That will be the best part, for sure.

I suppose I should get back to work now, but excitement like this needs someplace to be poured out, even if it is just to a window in WordPress. :-)
