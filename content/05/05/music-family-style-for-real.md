Well, the [long-awaited Sunday](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/05/04/making-music-family-style/) finally got here and I got to play keyboards in the worship team at my family's church with my brother [Andrew](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hubbs86) leading. It was _awesome._ It was his first time leading a worship band but he did a very good job. The set list was something like this:

- Blessed Be Your Name
- Be Glorified In Me
- Unfailing Love _(a new Chris Tomlin song... very good, very singable)_
- Draw Me Close
- Knowing You
- I Will Praise Him Still

Somewhere in there Andrew and Ryan (another of my brothers) and I did a special number, the old Steve Camp song _Love That Will Not Let Me Go_. It was fantastic.

I really enjoyed getting to play keys and sing backup on the team; I've been leading my own team for so long, it was fun to play second-fiddle. It was also really neat to see my brother pursue a dream of his, to lead the team. I'm sure he'll be doing it again... and maybe one of these days I'll get him to come down here and play on my team. :-)
