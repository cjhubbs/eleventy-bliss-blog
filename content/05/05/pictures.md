OK, not too much to report from the weekend; still didn't get any of the projects done - it was too cold. On Sunday we had an ordination service for a friend from church; it's fun to see somebody pointed in the direction of full-time service, wondering where they'll end up. Godspeed, Sam.

My only other purpose for this post was to share a couple pictures snapped over the weekend. They are (admittedly) on the goofy side - but then I guess, so am I... at least I was this weekend. The cute little girl is my daughter Laura, and the guy with the goofy look on his face is me... I don't always look that stupid, I promise... :-) I wasn't really mugging for the camera; I was mugging for Laura, trying to get her to laugh, and Becky managed to snap the shutter at just the wrong moment. :-)
