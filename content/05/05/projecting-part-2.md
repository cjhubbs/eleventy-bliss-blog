My regular readers (all two of them :-)) will remember my frustration a few days ago over [trying to get projector bids](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/05/03/projecting/), and my excitement at the thought that we might finally get a projector set up for [our church](http://www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org). Well I finally got the bid from [National Projector](http://www.nationalprojector.com/), and then at the elders meeting yesterday they approved my plan to accept the bid from [Shepherd Multimedia](http://www.shepherdmin.com/). So, today I will be ordering a [Hitachi CP-X885W projector](http://www.hitachi.us/Apps/hitachicom/content.jsp?page=LCOSLCDProjectors/CurrentModels/XGA/details/CP-X885W.html&level=4&section=LCOSLCDProjectors&parent=details&godparent=XGA&nav=left&path=jsp/hitachi/forhome/DigitalMedia/) (3500 lumens strong) and a long-throw lens.

And there was much rejoicing. Maybe I'll get time next week to install it; more likely it'll get installed during Memorial Day weekend. Can't wait to hear the buzz in the sanctuary when folks notice it for the first time...
