Our first softball game of the season is tonight. I'm soooo much looking forward to it. It'll be nasty conditions for playing - probably 50 degrees and a 20 mph wind. But that's not the point - it's just great to be out playing.

I'll have the additional fun of getting to umpire the early game - in our league it's recreational enough that we don't have paid umps, instead each team that plays the early game supplies somebody to ump for the late game, and _vice versa_. I enjoy the umping at least as much as the playing.... weird.

Hopefully Laura doesn't freeze tonight out with us; if she's getting cold, it'll be up to me to keep track of her so Becky can keep playing. The joys of spring softball in Iowa - we had flurries here this morning! :-)
