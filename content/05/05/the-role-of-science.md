This little blurb caught my eye today while reading Opinion Journal's Best of the Web... They're talking about scientists' studies on homosexuality, and how they impact our views of it.... and here's the quote:

"\[Science\] deals in the realm of observable facts, not values. Science can inform moral judgments, but it can never resolve them."

Bingo.
