Thursday morning I had the delightful experience of having 4 wisdom teeth removed. It's the first real dental work I've ever had to have done, so I wasn't really looking forward to it. But they needed to be removed, so I dutifully reported to the oral surgeon's office at 8 AM, prepared for a weekend of pain and pills.

It's actually been a lot better than I feared it would be. Thursday was still pretty much a loss, but I wasn't in a lot of pain. Friday I felt pretty good. I probably could've gone to work on Friday, but I'd already prepared everybody for my being gone, so why mess things up for them? :-) It's now Saturday morning, and my mouth is still pretty swollen, but I keep popping the ibuprofen, and other than that the pain is mostly gone. I'll have to be careful what I eat for the next several days, but I can live with that.

The only thing I really needed to get done this weekend was mow the lawn, and so I've been figuring that by today I'd be ready to get out and mow. Well of course last night it had to rain, and it's been threatening rain all morning, so I don't think I'm going to get it done. Maybe tomorrow. I guess I could go outside and help Becky with her flowers...

This is probably the most boring random journal-type blog entry I've written in some time, but I guess it's been slow enough that I don't have much to post about. Either that or I'm just slow enough that I can't think of anything... :-)
