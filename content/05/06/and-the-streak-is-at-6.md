You gotta love the Chicago Cubs. They brought a guy up from Triple-A to start last night's game against the Dodgers, and he gets a win in his first major league start. He was the tenth different starting pitcher the Cubs have used already this season, and we're only two months in!

For as miserable as the season has seemed at times so far, the Cubs are 3 games over .500, in second place in the NL Central (6.5 games back), have the league's leading hitter in average, (tied for the lead in) HRs, and RBIs (Derrek Lee), and have managed to bang out 6 wins in a row, including a series sweep of the Dodgers.

I'm a happy Cubs fan this morning. :-)
