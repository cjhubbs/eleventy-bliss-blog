Now that the infamous projector is back on track, I've been able to devote myself to other nerdiness. Yesterday I set up a [bulletin board](http://cafe.recminusa.org/forum) (gotta love phpBB) for the [Conversation Cafe](http://cafe.recminusa.org) that my pastor runs at his [coffee shop](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com). I don't know that it'll get a lot of traffic, but it will be a good place for the college kids that participate in the Cafe discussions to continue them online. I know next to nothing about administrating a bb, so I'll be doing some quick learning over the next few days/weeks. At least I have a [well-run board](http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/index.php) I can look to for an example. :-)
