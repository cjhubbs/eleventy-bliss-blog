This has definitely been one of those boring weeks, especially as far as work is concerned. [As I wrote about before](/05/05/here-goes-nothin/), I have been assigned to be the team lead for a new project. It's not a particularly big or long project as our projects go, probably me and one other software person for 12 months. It's becoming less scary as I get into it further; I'm understanding exactly what needs done, and I know I can handle it... I've done most all of it before.

The bad part this week is the boredom; we're in a planning phase where our plan isn't due until the end of this month. My project lead was on vacation all of this week and will be all of next week, too. I need her input to finish planning. So what do I get in the mean time? I have a bunch of half-finished spreadsheets that need her input and approval before I can finish them. I've had most of those done since the early part of this week. So I'm sitting here now posting on my blog, inflicting my boredom on you readers who are probably now bored reading this.

I hate having nothing to do. If I have tasks to work on, I'm a happy camper, the day goes fast, I'm ultra-productive, things are good. When I don't have stuff to do, I go crazy. Time drags. Listening to music doesn't seem to help. I can't exactly sit here and read a book... although maybe there are some technical journals or FAA publications or something that I can read. Yeah, that'd be exciting. :-)

I don't even know if I feel better after having complained here about my boredom... but it least I spent 5 minutes doing it... less than three hours until the workday is over....
