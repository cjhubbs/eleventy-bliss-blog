As I noted in [my post to Mr. Murphy](/05/06/mr-murphy-works-on-sundays/) a week or so ago, I've been having problems with the new projector at church. I talked to the tech support guy today and we walked through stuff for 15 minutes, and he couldn't figure anything out either. He left me with two other things to try, and if neither of them worked, then we'd send the thing back for warranty repair.

I tried the first, which was to send a composite video signal through. It worked just fine. So then I tried the second, which entailed getting the projector down from its stand and taking it into the office to hook it up directly to a desktop PC. Still no dice. At this point I'm pretty frustrated, and just sitting there thinking about what else it could be. I idly started playing with the rotary input control on the top of the projector, and all of a sudden - voila! It's working! What could it have been?

The whole time I have been pushing the VIDEO button on the remote control, trying to cycle through composite video, S-video, and BNC. What I hadn't been doing is pushing the RGB button right next to it. Arrrgh. As soon as I push that button, it switches to the RGB source, and everything works fine.

I should have my geek status revoked for a week or two for this one.

\[Note to tech support: even if the guy on the other end sounds smart, don't assume that he is. Remember that there's a RGB button on the remote, and ask specifically if he's using it. Even smart-sounding guys can overlook obvious stuff when it's a new piece of equipment.\]
