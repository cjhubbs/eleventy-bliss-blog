And so today the [musical baton was passed to me](http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2005/06/01/musical-baton/) by [Jeff Holland](http://thedirtroad.net/jeff). It seems like a fun idea, but it will be agonizing to have to make some of these choices...

**Amount of music on your computer?**

OK, this one is easy, thanks to iTunes. 4123 songs, 12.8 days, 15.03 GB. That's basically my entire collection - now how much of it I regularly listen to is an entirely separate question - it would be a much shorter list. The total list is bloated by a bunch of classical stuff and then my wife's albums (things like the entire collected works of Jim Brickman, Best of Air Supply, other stuff to scary to admit is on there...)

**Currently listening to?**

_Hurry_, Sleeping at Last, _Ghosts_

**Five songs that mean a lot to you?**

_Wedding Dress_, [Derek Webb](http://derekwebb.com) This springs to mind almost instantly; to me it embodies that spirit of brokenness and repentance that I constantly need to have before God.

_Somewhere North of Here_, [Caedmon's Call](http://caedmonscall.com) (Derek Webb :-)) One of my favorite CC songs, one of the early ones that hooked me.

There aren't many others that come to mind, so let's see what iTunes says I've been listening to...

_Don't Think Twice, It's Alright_, [Bob Dylan](http://bobdylan.com) I was introduced to this song by [a guy I know](http://www.billyheller.com/) who sings in [my favorite coffeeshop](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com). It's good, simple, early Dylan.

_Say_, [Sleeping At Last](http://www.sleepingatlast.com) Not necessarily even my favorite Sleeping At Last song (that probably goes to _Currents_, but it's the first one on the album, and so it gets played the most.

_I Get A Kick Out Of You_, [Jamie Cullum](http://www.jamiecullum.com) The young Brit sensation covers an old Cole Porter song. A fun big-band-type arrangement with some good piano work thrown in. I have a huge appreciation for guys like Jamie who have gone back and revived the old big band and jazz.

**Top five albums?**

Oh gosh, this is a tough one.

_Long Line of Leavers_, Caedmon's Call This was my first taste of Caedmon's, and still, I think, my favorite overall album. If only they could have left off _Valleys Fill First_...

_The House Show_, Derek Webb OK, this is a cop-out - it's not either of his actual studio albums, but it's live, which kicks it up a notch in my book, it has the best of _She Must and Shall Go Free_, and it includes Derek's cover of Bob Dylan's _Every Grain of Sand_, which is one of my favorites (of Derek's, not of Dylan's).

_Ghosts_, Sleeping at Last This one has grown on me a ton since I first listened to it. It's the direction that I like rock music to go, and I reserve it for either times when I need to tune out at work (which must be often, seeing how many times I've played the album) or while I'm driving with the windows down in the car.

_When Harry Met Sally Soundtrack_, Harry Connick, Jr. Here's my nod to the jazz and big band that I love so much. To think that Harry was early 20's and recording this album just blows me away. I fell in love with the mellow saxophone solo on _Love is Here to Stay_ way back in high school and it's still one of my favorite songs. And the piano solo version of _Winter Wonderland_ just makes me shake my head in wonder. Good stuff.

_Photographs_, Andrew Osenga I always skip _Kankakee_ and start the album off with _Kara_. From there on, it's solid all the way through _New Mexico_ at the end.

_A Rush of Blood to the Head_, Coldplay OK, so I'm listing six albums. I couldn't decide between Andy O and Coldplay, so you get both. This one gets a lot of playtime, too.

**Last album bought?**

It's hard to remember. I think it was Eric Clapton's _Unplugged_, which is a very fine album. I just had somebody give me a copy of Andrew Peterson's _Behold the Lamb of God_, and it's top-notch as well.

**Recent discoveries?**

Jamie Cullum, Andy Osenga, and Sleeping at Last all appeared on my radar about 2 years ago. Sandra McCracken was a nice discovery earlier this year. (Don't know why I neglected to buy her stuff for so long...)

**Passing on the musical baton.** Let's see... [Silly Joe](http://rmfo-blogs.com/sillyjoe/) [Amber](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=amburgler7) [Richard](http://rmfo-blogs.com/richard) [Danielle](http://rmfo-blogs.com/danielle/) [Chris from L.C.](http://rmfo-blogs.com/chris/)
