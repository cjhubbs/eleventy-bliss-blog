Becky went to a women's retreat this weekend. She left Friday afternoon and didn't get back until Saturday night. It was my first real extended time of getting to "kid wrangle", as Steve puts it. (Of course, he's got three kids, so my one probably doesn't really count...) I have gained an entirely new appreciation for the things my wife deals with on a daily basis.

I had 28-or-so hours that Becky was gone, and had one real task I needed to complete: the back yard needed mowed. That was just about all I got done while she was gone. Well, not quite all. I did get over to church to finish debugging the problems with the projector... and didn't get anywhere. I'll talk through it with tech support today. And I did spend a couple hours while she was napping Saturday afternoon watching the Cubs game. So I could have gotten a couple other things done. But still.

There's this whole issue of how much stuff there is to remember with a kid; you have to remember to take the diaper bag everywhere, and to remember to refill it when it's empty. And remembering to check (and change) her diaper often enough that she's comfortable and not overflowing... And remembering to take the opportunity to change her diaper at the "family room" on the one end of the mall before walking all the way to the other end. And remembering to use the facilities before you leave home since it's a real pain to try to park a stroller in the restroom next to you when you're out... And remembering that mealtimes aren't nearly so flexible for Laura as they are for me... 7, noon, and 5 are pretty well set in stone. And on... and on... I assume you're getting the idea.

Laura and I had a good time while Becky was gone; we spent a lot of time together, and that's good. I don't get to spend as much time with her as I'd like to. But I'll tell you this - we were both sure glad to see her get home. :-)
