So, it' 8:30 on Saturday morning and I'm sitting here in the dining room watching Laura finish her breakfast. Her normal schedule is 16 oz of formula in the morning, but she's drinking out of a 7 oz bottle. That means the real trick for mom and dad is to notice when the bottle's getting empty so we can refill it before she throws it on the floor. Then she'll eat her Cheerios, so I guess she's doing like I do and having her bowl of cereal in the morning, she's just having it separately whereas I put my milk and Cheerios together. :-)

I think it's going to be a fairly slow Saturday, which will be nice. Just some odd tasks to complete around the house, and I need to go to the music store and buy a new microphone boom since mine at church has totally stripped out and won't hold my mic up. Oh, and I have to type up the powerpoint slides for tomorrow's church service.... such are the hazards of getting a new projector.

Well Becky just got up now so I suppose that means it's time for the day to start. Thank God for weekends. :-)
