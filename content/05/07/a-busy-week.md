This upcoming week is gonna be a hum-dinger. Tonight is softball, first umping, then playing. Tuesday night is a church leadership meeting. Wednesday night is worship team. (Note to self: gotta get WT reorganization plans going.) Thursday night [Mark Smiley](http://www.virtualsmiley.net) is coming over for dinner. Friday night my folks, [brot](http://www.xanga.com/StAndrean)[hers](http://www.xanga.com/hubbs86), sister, and [friend](http://www.xanga.com/amburgler7) come to visit for the weekend and celebrate Laura's birthday. They stay until Sunday night, and then Monday I take off to Norfolk, VA, for the DER conference. Maybe I can get some rest there... :-)
