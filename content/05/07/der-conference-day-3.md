Today was the third and final day of the conference here in Norfolk. The conference itself was uneventful; heard a few presentations on the committees that are meeting to develop new guidelines for software certification. I'm sure I'd bore every single one of my readers if I actually described the details of the presentations, so I'll stop. :-)

After the conference, I walked over to St. Pauls Episcopal church, just a few blocks away. St. Paul's has met on that particular location since 1639. Parts of the current building date back to 1690 or so. There are a bunch of graves surrounding the church; some of those grave markers date back to the 1690's as well. It's quite a fascinating thing to visit a graveyard anywhere; but in the midwest the veteran markers we see usually commemorate WW I or WW II, or in rare cases the Civil War. In this graveyard there were several markers of folks who were Revolutionary War veterans. Too cool. There is also a small cannonball (it looked to be about grapefruit-sized) still embedded in the bricks of the building that was fired by the British back during the Revolutionary War. I love the east coast of the US for all the history. I can't imagine how blown-away I'd be by European history if I ever get over there.

Did a bit of shopping after the church visit (hey, gotta pick up \*something\* for the wife and kiddo while I'm here), ate dinner (Max & Erma's again... tasty!) and headed back to the hotel for a soak in the hot tub and now Sportscenter on TV. Ah... nice to relax. Suppose I should turn it in now so I can get up early in the morning; oughtta be checked out of here by 7 or so for a 9:10 AM flight.

That's the report from Norfolk. I'll try to remember to post some pictures when I get back home.
