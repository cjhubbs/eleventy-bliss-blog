Don't be surprised if you see occasional downtime on my blog here over the next several days; the server on which it runs has been under attack by spammers for the last week and [Geof](http://www.ijsm.org) (the trusty and generous hosting provider) is having the server wiped and then [doing a full re-load this weekend](http://ijsm.org/archives/2005/07/14/i-hate-computers/).

Best wishes to Geof as he spends his weekend at a no-fun task.
