Tuesday I found a bootleg concert recording of [Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com) opening for [Caedmon's Call](http://www.caedmonscall.com) in Minot, ND. I'd never heard his music before; I knew that he's written some good stuff for Caedmon's, and that [Andy Osenga](http://www.caedmonscall.net/osenga/) speaks highly of him, but that was about it. So, I downloaded the songs and decided to give him a listen. Wow, what I have been missing!

The song that has totally captured my head at the moment is from his Peanuts trilogy on his latest album, War and Peace. I'm not sure whether it's #1 or #3; the bootleg says it's #3, but when I listen to the clips of his songs from his website, it sounds like it's #1. I guess I'll find out for sure once I get the CD; I ordered it back on Tuesday. Hoping it might come before I head out to Norfolk next week, but I'm not holding my breath. Anyhow, he has Danielle Young (of Caedmon's) singing with him on this one, and it's just the perfect folksy mix of terrific lyrics and fun music; I've had it on repeat for the last hour or so in iTunes and I'm not ready to turn it off yet.

> He \[Schroeder\] played like Harry Truman, without those cokebottles that only Marcie wore, Like Harry Truman, without the atom bomb, Without the burden of a third world war.

Brilliant.
