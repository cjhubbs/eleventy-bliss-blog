It never fails. I start working on a not-approved-yet-but-probably-OK change request today, and after about an hour of code modification the requirements guy sticks his head into my cubicle.

"Hey Chris, don't know if you're working on those changes yet, but they should all be OK except for Oil Pressure - there's some big changes coming for that one."

What have I been working on for the last hour? Oil Pressure. :-)
