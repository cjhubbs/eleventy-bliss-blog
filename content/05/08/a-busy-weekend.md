I haven't posted much this week... it's been just a bit on the busy side. There's been plenty to do at work, which means little boredom or free time, and the evenings have been just crazy.

This afternoon my family is coming to visit, which I'm very excited about - I haven't seen my brother Aaron since Christmas since he's been in Panama doing missions work. They'll be staying all weekend.

Tonight I have a wedding rehearsal for a friend; I'm playing the piano and singing. Last night I had to write a transcription of a song that she wants played that there's no sheet music for. It's an instrumental from the soundtrack to the movie _[Love Actually](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314331/)_. It's a nice little instrumental, not too tough. Still, extra hassle having to transcribe. I just don't trust my memory enough to do it without some music.

Saturday is the wedding, and I also need to get music together with my brothers for leading worship on Sunday. Still not sure what we're going to do, but I'll try to get a couple of them involved.

Sunday I'm not only leading worship, but also filling the pulpit since the pastor's on vacation. This'll be my third time preaching a full sermon, so I'm not really worried about it, but it's just another thing I have to try to stuff into my brain so that I'm not just totally reading it off of the page. The sermon is going to be from [2 Thess 1:11-12](http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=2+thess+1%3A11-12&sourceid=mozilla-search), if you're really interested.

I think by Sunday night I'll be ready to collapse. About my only remaining task after that is to ensure I have a musician lined up for next week's worship, since I'll be taking the week off. I can't wait...
