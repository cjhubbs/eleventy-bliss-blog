Everybody's favorite web admin and forum tyrant, [Geof Morris](http://ijsm.org), is participating in today's Blogathon on behalf of the [Blood:Water Mission](http://bloodwatermission.org/). Specifically, he's committed to posting on his blog no less frequently than twice per hour for 24 hours and is signing people up as sponsors.

Happy blogging Geof!
