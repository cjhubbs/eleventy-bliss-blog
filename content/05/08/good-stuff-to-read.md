[Andy Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog) really hit it on the head with some thoughts [here](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2005/08/14/the-third-commandment/) about "Christian music" and "Christian culture". His [interaction](http://readshlog.blogspot.com/2005/08/swelling-rebellion.html) with [Shaun Groves](http://readshlog.blogspot.com/) (another artist and blogger) is well worth the read.
