OK, I'll admit it: I have a CD-buying habit. It's not as destructive or expensive as many other habits I could have, but it still drives me to purchase more music, new music all the time.

My last new CD came in the mail on Friday - I had pre-ordered [Chris Rice](http://www.chrisrice.com/)'s new CD, _amused_, back a couple of months ago. I'm not sure how well I like it yet; I'll have to listen some more. Chris Rice has been on my automatically-buy list pretty much ever since his first album, and I haven't been disappointed yet. Hopefully the streak continues. Before that, I got [Andy Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com)'s _[Souvenirs & Postcards]_, and then just before that [Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com)'s _War and Peace_. I guess you could say I'm just doing catch-up as I find these new artists that I like so much.

Since I have to hold back a bit, I'll at least post my list here so I can add to it from time to time, or note when I have purchased another one. If any of you reading this feel the desire to get one for me, go ahead. :-) They are listed in a basic priority order... which is always subject to change.

**[The Normals](http://www.thenormals.com/)** I don't own any of their albums yet, but I should get all of them:\_

- A Place Where You Belong
- Coming To Life
- Better Than This

They are available, all 3 for $24 at [http://www.creativesitesmedia.com/normals/merch.shtml](http://www.creativesitesmedia.com/normals/merch.shtml#music). I will admit to being torn between getting them for that good price or supporting Andy O directly by buying them from his site at a slightly higher price.

**[Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com)**

- Arkadelphia
- The Hymnal

Available for purchase at [http://www.uthstuph.com/ws/randallgoodgame/](http://www.uthstuph.com/ws/randallgoodgame/). I appreciate his _War and Peace_ more every time I hear it... I need to catch up on his other stuff.

**[Sufjan Stevens](http://www.sufjan.com)**

- Illinois

[I wrote about this one before.](/05/08/come-on-feel-the-illinoise/) I still haven't purchased it.

**[Sandra McCracken](http://www.sandramccracken.com)**

- Gypsy Flat Road
- The Crucible

I have only one of Sandra's albums right now: _Best Laid Plans_. I'd sure like to add the other two.

Other things floating around at the bottom of the list: Ryan Adams' _[Cold Roses]_, and maybe Nickel Creek's _[Why Should the Fire Die?]_.

I guess that's it for now. I imagine I'll be adding to this list before I subtract from it too much. :-)
