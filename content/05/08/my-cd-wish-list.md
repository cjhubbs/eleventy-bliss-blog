OK, I'll admit it: I have a CD-buying habit. It's not as destructive or expensive as many other habits I could have, but it still drives me to purchase more music, new music all the time.

My last new CD came in the mail on Friday - I had pre-ordered [Chris Rice](http://www.chrisrice.com/)'s new CD, _amused_, back a couple of months ago. I'm not sure how well I like it yet; I'll have to listen some more. Chris Rice has been on my automatically-buy list pretty much ever since his first album, and I haven't been disappointed yet. Hopefully the streak continues. Before that, I got [Andy Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com)'s _[Souvenirs & Postcards](http://www.andrewosenga.com/store/item_info.php?id=3)_, and then just before that [Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com)'s _War and Peace_. I guess you could say I'm just doing catch-up as I find these new artists that I like so much.

Since I have to hold back a bit, I'll at least post my list here so I can add to it from time to time, or note when I have purchased another one. If any of you reading this feel the desire to get one for me, go ahead. :-) They are listed in a basic priority order... which is always subject to change.

**[The Normals](http://www.thenormals.com/)** I don't own any of their albums yet, but I should get all of them:_

- A Place Where You Belong
- Coming To Life
- Better Than This

_They are available, all 3 for $24 at [http://www.creativesitesmedia.com/normals/merch.shtml](http://www.creativesitesmedia.com/normals/merch.shtml#music). I will admit to being torn between getting them for that good price or supporting Andy O directly by buying them from his site at a slightly higher price.

**[Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com)**_

- Arkadelphia

- The Hymnal

_

Available for purchase at [http://www.uthstuph.com/ws/randallgoodgame/](http://www.uthstuph.com/ws/randallgoodgame/). I appreciate his _War and Peace_ more every time I hear it... I need to catch up on his other stuff.

**[Sufjan Stevens](http://www.sufjan.com)**_

- Illinois

_[I wrote about this one before.](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/08/18/come-on-feel-the-illinoise/) I still haven't purchased it. Available at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=caedmonscalln-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B0009R1T7M%2526tag=caedmonscalln-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B0009R1T7M%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon").

**[Sandra McCracken](http://www.sandramccracken.com)**_

- Gypsy Flat Road
- The Crucible

_

I have only one of Sandra's albums right now: _Best Laid Plans_. I'd sure like to add the other two.

Other things floating around at the bottom of the list: Ryan Adams' _[Cold Roses](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=caedmonscalln-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B0007YMUZW%2526tag=caedmonscalln-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B0007YMUZW%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")_, and maybe Nickel Creek's _[Why Should the Fire Die?](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=caedmonscalln-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B0009ML2BU%2526tag=caedmonscalln-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B0009ML2BU%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")_.

I guess that's it for now. I imagine I'll be adding to this list before I subtract from it too much. :-)
