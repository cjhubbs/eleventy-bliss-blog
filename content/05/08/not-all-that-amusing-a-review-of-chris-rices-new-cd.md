I pre-ordered Chris Rice's new album, _amusing_, back a couple of months ago when it was advertised by [eb+flo](http://www.ebflo.com). This is Chris's first album with his new record label, [INO](http://www.inorecords.com/home/main.html), so I was looking forward to hearing what the effort would sound like. The album doesn't hit the stores until tomorrow (Tuesday August 23rd), but I received my copy in the mail last Friday. Having now had the chance to listen to it a couple times, I'll hazard an opinion or two.

**The Music** Musically, Chris makes the most of being on a new record label that has, apparently, given him much more musical freedom. The styles are varied; from the Steven Curtis Chapman-esque bluesy-country-rock of _Love Like Crazy_, to the made-for-adult-contemporary-radio sound of _When Did You Fall_, to the quiet piano-driven tones of _Sleepyhead Sun_, he explores many sounds that will a suprise to those familiar with his discography. I could complain that it isn't very cohesive in sound, but that's the case with most of Chris's albums, so I won't suddenly hold it against him now.

**The Content** The subject matter of the songs is perhaps also typically varied; he includes a couple songs that deal with romantic love which lead me to wonder if he (the long-time bachelor) has a new relationship that is driving these thoughts. But the interviews I've read don't mention a thing about it, nor do the liner notes. Bummer.

**The Lyrics** Here's where I am more disappointed with _amusing_. It seems to be missing a song or two with the depth that his previous albums have included. Think back on _Deep Enough to Dream_ (from the album _Deep Enough to Dream_), _The Power of a Moment_ (from _Past the Edges_), _Home Tonight_ (from _Smell the Color 9_), _Untitled Hymn (Come to Jesus)_, or _Wonder_ (both from _Run the Earth, Watch the Sky_). They are songs full of picturesque, thoughtful lyrics, laden with symbolism and imagery. They are the depth that keeps me coming back to those albums again and again. Sadly, _amusing_ doesn't seem to include much of anything in that vein.

What it does contain in great measure is the more overt, and, to my mind, less-insightful lyrics that eventually drove me away from the music of Steven Curtis Chapman. For instance, the chorus of _Love Like Crazy_:

> Love like crazy We gotta love like crazy We gotta love like crazy The way he loves you and me 'Cause if the world's ever gonna change We gotta love like crazy

This may be insightful and motivating for the high-school camp crowd, but it leaves me wanting more. Or this one:

> Life gave me lemonade and I can't imagine why Born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky I live life without pretending I'm a sucker for happy endings Thanks for the lemonade Thanks for the lemonade!

Sure, it's OK.... but color me a bit disappointed.

This album will not really change my overall opinion of Chris Rice; he's still one of my favorite songwriters, he's still provided some of the most thoughtful and worshipful stuff that I've ever heard. I'm hoping that _amusing_ is just one slightly low spot in the road that will quickly be forgotten when the next album comes around. It may, though, prompt me to skip the pre-ordering next time and wait to get a listen before making my purchase.
