Just miscellaneous stuff from my life today. I got my DSL modem hooked up last night so the Casa de Cakeboy is now surfing the web at high speed and wirelessly! I'm sure it'll take me a while to fully comprehend the different things this will allow me to do online... fun fun!

Tomorrow I'm getting a new car stereo installed in the Saturn. The old one is the factory-installed basic model, and the two big problems are that a) one of the knobs is broken, and b) there's no good way to get iPod music through the stereo. (Waiting for somebody to suggest an FM modulator... decided against it.) The new deck was one of the less-expensive ones at Best Buy, but it has the magic feature: an AUX input to run a line in from the iPod. I can't wait. Especially if I'm doing road trips to Oklahoma and Door County, Wisconsin in the next few months... gotta have the music. I've had an iTrip FM transmitter for the past several months and have come to the conclusion that it just doesn't have the power to give me decent sound quality, and in addition it's really annoying having to switch frequencies every hour or so. So, the deck gets installed tomorrow. I got free installation on it too.
