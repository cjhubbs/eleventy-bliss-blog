My prepaid mailing label came in the mail yesterday, so last night after softball I went to get everything boxed up. Needing to send along a copy of my original purchase receipt, I went down to my scanner to make a copy... and the scanner apparently has died. Great.

So, it didn't get packaged last night. I'll make a copy this morning, and then box it and take it to the post office this afternoon after work. If their original schedule is accurate, then I should be receiving my replacement gift card in, oh, about 3 weeks... :-(
