Sent the package off yesterday afternoon... it's headed to Dallas. I'm guessing the good ol' US Postal Service should have it there no later than Saturday.

On the other hand, we got the new laptop yesterday so now I have a lot of fun setup tasks in front of me, including the wireless network. I really do enjoy setup tasks.
