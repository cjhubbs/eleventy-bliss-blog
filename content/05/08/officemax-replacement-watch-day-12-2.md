No events to report today.

It is starting to drive me crazy not having my PDA. I didn't realize how much I rely on it for calendar and note-taking (not to mention game-playing) until I've been without it for the better part of two weeks. If I had any other big purchases planned, I'd just go buy one from somewhere today and then use the OfficeMax gift card later for that purchase... but I don't know what it might be.
