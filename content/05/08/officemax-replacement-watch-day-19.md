Almost three weeks now and still nothin'. Geof suggests I should skip the Tungsten and go for a Treo. I suppose that's an option, although if the Treo ever breaks then that means not only have I lost my PDA but I've lost my cellphone, too...

The other thing that irks me about Palm (not OfficeMax) is that none of the PDAs come with cradles any more. They all have a mini-USB port for syncing and a separate power cord. Dang it, I like the cradle. It gives me a place to keep my PDA charged and visible while I'm at my desk. They sell one, but it's an extra $40. They used to include it with the PDA. Arrrgh.

As an addition: I just found this fun clause in the OfficeMax MaxAssurance [fine print](http://www.officemax.com/max/solutions/product/article.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=no&edOID=537034147):

> Meaningful service will be initiated within 48 hours of Your request and will be completed as soon as reasonably possible. If no meaningful service is initiated within such time limits and You have reasonably been available within such time limits, You may engage Your own servicer at Our expense.

Such great nebulous terms. "meaningful service". What if I don't think it's meaningful? "As soon as reasonably possible." I've got to think that three weeks (and counting) is waaaaaay longer than "reasonably possible." I think it's time to write a nasty letter to the store and regional managers...
