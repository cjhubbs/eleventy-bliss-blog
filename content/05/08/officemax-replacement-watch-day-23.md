Still nothin'.

On another warranty replacement topic, I remembered this morning that the [Countryman E6 microphone that broke on me](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/06/06/mr-murphy-works-on-sundays/) has been in for warranty repair for nearly two months now, with no response from [Countryman](http://www.countryman.com/). Guess I'd better get back on their case about it.
