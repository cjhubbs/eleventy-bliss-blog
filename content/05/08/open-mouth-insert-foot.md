It has come to my attention that some folks from my church have been reading and are reacting negatively to [my post on all of our changes](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/07/20/nothing-is-constant-except-change/). I have been wrestling with how to respond.

The specific reaction is to some commentary I made in the last few paragraphs. I have re-read it and feel that, while the feelings are real, the numbers were mis-stated, and I made far too much of a blanket statement when many of the older folks in our congregation are in favor of the changes we are making.

I would like to apologize to and ask forgiveness for my misstatements and my speaking out-of-place. I am learning, as I go, about this whole blogging thing and that I might have readers that I haven't anticipated. Some inner dialogue is best left there.
