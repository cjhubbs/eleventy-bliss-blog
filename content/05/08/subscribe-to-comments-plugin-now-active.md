After seeing the feature on [Mark's blog](http://rmfo-blogs.com/rumorsage), I had to get it myself. It's a slick plugin. Not many people are brave enough (or really care) to subscribe to the entire comments feed of a blog, but occasionally you'd like to stay a part of one particular conversation or thread. This plugin (with its homepage [here](http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/)) allows you to just that. Good stuff.
