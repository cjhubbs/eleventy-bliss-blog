I haven't written many (any?) posts on my first year's worth of experience as a parent... not sure why. But there was one little episode tonight that was too funny.

I was sitting at the dining room table, eating a late supper - a Whopper and fries from Burger King (yum yum). Laura was sitting under the table near my chair, begging french fries. I noticed as she was sitting there that there was a diaper sitting next to her on the floor; I assumed that it was one that she had pulled out of the diaper bag during one of her usual unload-the-whole-bag-on-the-floor sessions. So, I think nothing of it.

A few minutes later, we're about ready to go for a walk. Becky asked me how her diaper was, if she needed changed before the walk or not. So I reach down to feel her diaper.... and, lo and behold, she doesn't have a diaper on. Somehow, while wearing a shirt and overall shorts, she managed to get her diaper off and out of her clothes. I wish \*I\* were that coordinated. :-) She was having a great time, very comfortable. Thankfully we caught it in time, so there were no puddles (or worse) to clean up.

Just another adventure in parenting.
