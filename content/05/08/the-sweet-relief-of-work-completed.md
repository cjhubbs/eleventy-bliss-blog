Last week was killer. I had soooo much to do. [I've talked about this already](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/08/12/a-busy-weekend/) so I won't go on and on again.

It all went really well. The wedding was beautiful. The music worked out just fine, and the song that I was singing (and had never sung before) was right in my comfortable singing range. All good.

Saturday night after the wedding, my brothers and I went over to the church and worked up our worship set for the Sunday service. After we got that together, it degenerated into a Caedmon's Call/Derek Webb jam session... good times.

Sunday morning the music went well; it was nice to have a strong lead guitar.... way to go Andrew!

Then came the sermon. I hadn't prepared quite as much as I would've liked, but the message got out anyway. It's a funny thing; you preach a sermon, and then the first 5 people that come up to you all say things like "hey, you made me think of \[this point\] or \[that point\]", and I'm standing there thinking, "wow, those are good points, how did I miss those?" But then I recognize and appreciate that God used my words to speak in specific ways to specific people, even if it wasn't what I thought I was going to teach them. Praise the Lord!

My family all took off for their respective homes after lunch on Sunday. After a short trip to the local sweet corn festival, it was time to come home and crash. The Cubs and the Cardinals were the Sunday night game on ESPN, and the Cubbies found a way to win the game! I can't make sense of how they can drop 8 in a row, including getting swept by the Reds, but then can take 3 out of 4 against the league-leaders... but it was a fun game to watch, a nice way to end the weekend.

Next weekend we're going to Wisconsin to visit the family again (gotta take the chances to see Aaron while he's in-country), and I've just about got everything taken care of. I still haven't managed to get ahold of the replacement pianist yet for Sunday... two e-mails and a phone message, and still no response. I hope she's in town...
