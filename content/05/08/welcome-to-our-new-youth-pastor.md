At our congregational meeting last night, Nathan Marsceau was called to be our new youth pastor! Nathan and his family (wife Amy, sons Tyler and Teagan) will be moving down to Iowa as soon as their house sells in the Twin Cities.

I'm excited to have Nathan on board and looking forward to ministering with him.
