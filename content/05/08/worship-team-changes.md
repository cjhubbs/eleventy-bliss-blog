We had our first worship team practice using individual microphones last night.

Currently, we just have one condenser mic on each side of the stage and 3 or 4 people gather around it. The sound quality is terrible. Thanks to Nate Hines who graciously loaned us 4 SM-58's, we now can practice using individual mics. We're going to split into two worship teams, each with 3 vocalists and some instrumentalists. The start date is Sept 11, so we've got some work to do pretty quickly. I think it'll turn out OK, though.

Practice last night went about as well as it possibly could have; the singers really noticed how much better things were with handheld mics - better sound, you can hear everybody... good stuff. It was kinda funny - I told Janice "sing louder, we can't hear you"... and her reply: "I thought if I can hear myself then I'm singing too loud..." Welcome to real sound with monitors! :-) It'll take some ironing out, but in the end it will be a huge improvement over our current configuration.
