So yesterday I took my guitar in to see about getting the pickup fixed.

Let me back up. I have a Takamine Acoustic/Electric that my folks got for me back 12 or so years ago. It's been a very serviceable guitar. About 2 years ago it developed a short in the end-pin jack, so I couldn't get it amplified. Now, I hadn't been playing it that much, so it didn't matter too much. Finally, about 18 months ago I took it in to our local guitar shop, [Stars Guitars](http://www.starsguitars.biz), to have them replace the jack. They replaced it, but then found that they couldn't get the pickup to work at all. So, they didn't charge me for the jack, but didn't solve my problem, either.

Fast forward to this week. I'm now playing guitar for church every-other week, and my in-hole single-coil passive pickup just isn't cutting it. So, I figured I'd take it back in and have them take another look. About an hour after I left it there, I get a call on my cell phone. When can I come pick it up?

It ends up that whoever installed the end pin jack last time wired it backwards. Oops. Switch the wires and everything works fine.

So I'll go pick it up tonight. Better late than never.
