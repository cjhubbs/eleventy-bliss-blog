At a used CD sale hosted by our local Youth for Christ chapter this weekend, I picked up [The Normals](http://www.thenormals.com/)' _Coming to Life_ and [Sandra McCracken](http://www.sandramccracken.com)'s _Gypsy Flat Road_ for $3 each. SCORE! Dunno why somebody would want to get rid of 'em, but I'll be happy to take advantage of that choice. :-)

I'll have to go update my [CD wish list](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/08/22/my-cd-wish-list/).
