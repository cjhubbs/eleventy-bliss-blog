I was remembering those Taco Bell ads the other day - the ones where a guy eats a burrito or something, and then comes out and reports in the glorious celebration "I'm full!" And everybody cheers. And it got me to thinking. Why is it that they think they need to celebrate being full?

I struggle off and on with being frustrated with my weight. I have a desk job, and I don't exersize much, and so I've battled "the bulge" for several years now. And as I got to thinking about it the other day, I was trying to remember the last time I really felt hungry. Typically what happens is that I eat my meals with largeish portions at regular times, (the family's gotta run on a schedule, after all), and I eat so much that I'm never really hungry - I'm just eating because I'm not too full and hey, it's time to eat.

So the last few days I've been making a bigger effort to eat less, and to enjoy the feeling of being hungry between meals. It's a little different, but it feels good. Now if I could just couple it with some exersize, maybe I'd be getting somewhere...

So forget about all those Taco Bell commercials. You don't really buy their food, anyway.... you just rent it for a while. :-) My new cause for celebration: I'm hungry!
