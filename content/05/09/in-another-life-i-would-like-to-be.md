I keep a little running list of things I'd like to do if I had another life to live. Not that I'm complaining about my life now - it's great and right where God wants me. But this is still a fun little list to keep. Feel free to add your own!

**In another life, I would like to be...**

- ...a Major League Baseball umpire
- ...an FBI agent
- ...a US senator
- ...a musician in a touring rock band
- ...a proprietor of a music store
- ...a crew member on a freighter or cruise ship

I'll add more later when I think of them.
