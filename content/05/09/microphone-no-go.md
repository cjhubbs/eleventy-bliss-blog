Well I finally heard back from [Countryman](http://www.countryman.com) again, and they have determined that I must have used excessive force to adjust the church's [E6 microphone](http://www.countryman.com/html_data_sheets/e6data.html), thus they are emphasizing the _limited_ portion of their warranty. They want about $215 to repair it.

On the joys, though, of having a professional sound guy that goes to our church: he tells me that wholesale is about $215 for one of those microphones, so I'll see about just buying a new one through him rather than paying similar money to have Countryman send me a "repaired" one.
