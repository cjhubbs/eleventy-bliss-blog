Becky was bored the other day and reading over some blogs (something she doesn't do very often), and after about an hour she informed my that my blog is boring. While other folks (my siblings and friends) tend to write about their feelings, what's going on in their lives, what they're learning, deep stuff, my posts tend to be more "informational".

I thought about it a bit and agreed with her; because I tend to post quickly, my posts end up being short bits of information, updates on my life, and occasionally reviews of things I've heard or read. You find precious little in the way of soul-searching or philosophizing. I'm not sure if it's because I don't do those things enough in the rest of my life, or if I just don't get them transferred to my blog with much regularity.

In my defense, I did point out to her that blogging styles differ greatly depending on the person; I gave her for reference [Geof's](http://www.ijsm.org) more terse, informational style, [Kari's](http://rmfo-blogs.com/karibeth/) writings on life (and her book reviews), and [Michaela's](http://forbieland.blogspot.com) [picturesque essays](http://forbieland.blogspot.com/2005/05/afternoon.html). I don't think she read them; she had to go do something else. She did remark, though, on how my being able to reference, from the top of my head, several other blogs for examples just made me even geekier. I suppose she's right.

Also in my defense, I noted that when I extra time to just sit and write, my writing style changes. Reference [a post](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/05/23/moody-conference-day-1/) from the pastor's conference this summer. She acknowledged that this was true, and that I don't have much time to write. Of course, then last night after I'd spent 45 minutes catching up on my blog reading while we were watching football, she remarked that if I hadn't spent all that time catching up on other people (most of whom I've never met), I'd have had time to write some stuff myself. Probably true, but I just wasn't ready to write last night. Reading was good.

So I guess from time to time I should try to make my blog more "interesting". In the mean time, bear with my "informational" style. :-) Hey, if anything, a blog should represent the personality of the person behind it... and mine does. Good enough for me.
