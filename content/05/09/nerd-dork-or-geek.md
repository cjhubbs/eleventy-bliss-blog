_HT to [Geof](http://ijsm.org/archives/2005/09/18/pure-nerd/), [Steve](http://rmfo-blogs.com/steve/archives/2005/09/18/outcast-genius/), and [Susan](http://rmfo-blogs.com/graceycat/archives/2005/09/19/and-proud-of-it/)._

<table align="center" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="5"><b>Pure Nerd</b></font><br>69 % Nerd, 43% Geek, 30% Dork</td></tr><tr><td>For The Record:<br><br><div></div>A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia.<br>A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often an obscure or difficult one.<br>A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social expectations/interactions.<br><div></div>You scored better than half in Nerd, earning you the title of: <b>Pure Nerd</b>.<br><br>The times, they are a-changing. It used to be that being exceptionally smart led to being unpopular, which would ultimately lead to picking up all of the traits and tendences associated with the "dork." No-longer. Being smart isn't as socially crippling as it once was, and even more so as you get older: eventually being a Pure Nerd will likely be replaced with the following label: Purely Successful.<br><br>Congratulations!<br><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>
