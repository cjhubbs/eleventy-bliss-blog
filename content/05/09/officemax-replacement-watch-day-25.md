Still counting. Maybe I'll get my gift card before the holiday weekend... but that may be too much to hope for.

I sent an inquiry last week via the OfficeMax website, requesting some contact information. I wrote:

> Could you please send me the name of the store manager for the Cedar Rapids, IA Collins Road store, and also the name and mailing address of the district manager who has oversight over that store? I would like to contact them regarding my recent store experience. Thanks!

This morning I finally recieved a response, but it was not very helpful...

> Thank you for your interest in OfficeMax.com. I don't have the name of the store manager. The district manager is \[name deleted\]. I have forwarded your email to his email address. I do apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused. If there was anything else we can help you with please feel free to contact us. Once again thank you for you interest in OfficeMax.com.

First of all, "Unique"?!? I hope that's not somebody's real name... secondly, they totally ignored my request for a mailing address. Maybe he'll respond via e-mail, but I doubt it. Grrrrr......

In other bad news, I heard back from [Countryman](http://www.countryman.com) about the broken E6 microphone. They seem to think that the [breakage](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/06/06/mr-murphy-works-on-sundays/) was my fault, i.e. not under warranty. They want to charge us $200+ bucks to fix it. Again, not happy. I'll keep my fingers crossed that maybe they'll see the light after I send them another e-mail or two. I mean, what good is a microphone if it breaks after the second or third minor adjustment?

Take heart, though, my entire life isn't this frustrating... I guess those parts are just the easy ones to blog about.
