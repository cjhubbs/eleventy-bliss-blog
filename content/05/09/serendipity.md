**_Practical definition:_**

Discovering a good concert near your home just a week before said concert.

Specifically? I was browsing [Andrew Peterson's website](http://www.andrew-peterson.com) this morning to get details on his Christmas tour.

OK, just a bit about the Christmas tour first. Andy P will be bringing his "Behold the Lamb" Christmas tour to Cedar Rapids, IA on Saturday, December 2. It apparently is being hosted by Youth for Christ as a fundraiser. Seeing as I know the local director of YFC, I'm going to have to see if they need any volunteer help for the day. :-) Bonus number 1 this morning was finding out that [Derek Webb](http://www.derekwebb.com), his wife [Sandra McCracken](http://www.sandramccracken.com), and [Jill Phillips](http://www.jillphillips.com) will all be coming along on this tour. (I suppose the die-hards already knew this, but it was news to me.) So, a big woohoo! for Andy, Derek, and Sandra all in concert in my home town.

Now, the other serendipity: Andy P will be playing a concert in Clermont, IA (about a 2-hour drive from my home) on October 1st (a week from Saturday). It looks like it's an outdoor concert, 3pm, at the "Cornfest" (and yes, I know, that sounds about as stereotypically Iowan as possible) at Heritage Farm Park in Clermont. Sounds like a nice way to spend a fall Saturday: a drive through the countryside, a good concert, who can ask for better? I'd been wishing to hear some of the stuff from _[The Far Country](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=caedmonscalln-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B000AARL7K%2526tag=caedmonscalln-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B000AARL7K%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")_ in concert... now my wish can be fulfilled.

Well, that's my happy report for the day. Rejoice with me! :-)
