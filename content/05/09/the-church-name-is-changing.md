After months of prayer, planning, and discussion, we took a congregational vote last night of intent to change the church name. The question wasn't one of voting for a specific new name; rather, in this step, we indicated our decision that we want the name to change. Next up is to pick a specific name. We'll meet again in a couple weeks to do that.

Our hope in this whole thing is that our church name would not be an impediment to the gospel. I think it's a good step.
