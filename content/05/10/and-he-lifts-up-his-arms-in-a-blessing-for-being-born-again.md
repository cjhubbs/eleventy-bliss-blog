Last week Becky and I were able to leave Laura with my folks and take a couple days of vacation up to Door County, Wisconsin. We'd never been there before, but had heard that the scenery was terrific. We weren't disappointed. We knew it was going to be dicey as to whether the leaves would still be on the trees at that date, (hey, we're cheap, we didn't want to pay peak-season rates for the hotel) but we figured it was worth a try.

Simply put, the scenery was magnificent. We drove down more little roads that were covered by archways of red and gold than I can recall to count. The weather was beautiful, even on the last day when it was raining. We had a very refreshing time, relaxing and taking in all the little towns: Egg Harbor, Fish Creek, Sister Bay, Bailey's Harbor, and some little places whose names have slipped my mind by now.

Friday night we ate at a [restaurant](http://www.missiongrille.com) that had live jazz all evening. Saturday morning we had pecan rolls at a bakery/restaurant that were "hailed as the best pecan rolls in Wisconsin". They weren't kidding. Door County has no chain restaurants or hotels any place north of Sturgeon Bay. It was refreshing to be able to choose between a bunch of unique cafes, restaurants, and supper clubs, rather than asking myself "so is it Subway, McDonalds, or Applebees tonight?".

Two establishments particularly caught my eye on the trip; sadly, I only got a picture of one of them: The Pudgy Seagull Restaurant. (I'll post the picture ASAP.) The other was for somebody's "Ho-Made" bakery items. For that special personal touch in baking... OK, I won't go there.

So it was a great weekend. It was no fun to wake up this morning and realize it was Monday and that meant I had to go back to work.... but it was at least nice to be well-rested while doing it. :-)
