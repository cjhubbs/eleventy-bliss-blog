...and stuff is a bit crazy here at work. Fortunately for me, I'm taking vacation this afternoon to help a friend move, and then Wednesday afternoon through Friday as we take a short vacation to Door County, Wisconsin. It should be beautiful this time of year - most of the leaves should still be around. I'll have to post some pictures once we get back.
