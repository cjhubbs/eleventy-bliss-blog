I got two more off [my CD wish list](http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/08/22/my-cd-wish-list/) yesterday:

_A Place Where You Belong_ - [The Normals](http://www.thenormals.com) _Cold Roses_ - [Ryan Adams and The Cardinals](http://www.ryan-adams.com/)

Another purchase that wasn't on my original list:

_Love and Thunder_ - [Andrew Peterson](http://www.andrew-peterson.com)

Good stuff. Andy P is awesome. But The Normals are awesome, too... and Ryan Adams is pretty darn good.

I love new music days!
