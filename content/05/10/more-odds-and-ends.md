I'm getting a cold. I'd forgotten how much I hate colds. You can't breathe, and your throat feels nasty. I'm thinking I might head home and try to take a nap.

On a totally unrelated note, there was a fun little episode with Laura last night that's worth relating. We were heading out to run a couple short errands last night, and she _really_ didn't want to get in her carseat. But she finally did, and we ran to the video store and then to pick up cheesesticks from Papa John's. In both cases, Laura and I just sat in the car while Becky ran in.

While we were waiting at Papa John's, I could tell she was really getting bored just sitting there, not getting to do anything. So, I grabbed a little toy rabbit and proceeded to play peekaboo between Laura and the rabbit, a game that she's enjoyed on previous occasions. After bemusedly considering the rabbit, she looked at me with a tired look that seemed to say "thanks for trying dad, it's not really that interesting, but I appreciate the effort." Hard to explain, but one of those mundane yet priceless moments that make parenting such a joy.
