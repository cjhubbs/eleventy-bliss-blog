So, after months of planning, debating, and voting, we finally have a new name for our church. Formerly Noelridge Baptist Church, we are now Noelridge Park Church. We will be implementing the change as quickly as possible.

I think it's a good choice. People wanted to keep the Noelridge name. (it's the name of the surrounding neighborhood.) They had discussed Community or Bible as words to go in the name, but those are so common as to be kind of "blah". "Park" is good since we're right across the street from the park, and it also has a bit of a stately feel to it.

I've got the domain name registered ([www.noelridgeparkchurch.org](http://www.noelridgeparkchurch.org)), and as soon as I can get a few pictures taken we'll have a new website up. We're still in need of a logo, so if any of my loyal readers happen to have mad talents with graphic design and want to do some _pro bono_ work, leave a comment and let me know.

It's fun to see things moving in this direction. I am excited as I look forward to what the Lord will do in the coming months.
