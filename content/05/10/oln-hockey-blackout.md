Yesterday night I sat down in front of the TV, looking forward to watching a hockey game. The Dallas Stars were playing the Phoenix Coyotes, and according to the TV schedule, it was slated to be broadcast on [OLN](http://www.olntv.com) (cable channel 69 in our area) at 7:30 PM central time. I was bewildered to find that rather than the NHL, OLN was showing some cheesy show about the "25 scariest animals" or the "10 worst jobs" or something like that. Where was my hockey?

A quick check of the [OLN website](http://www.olntv.com) confirmed that they were showing the NHL. They even have a cool graphic that says "NHL on OLN: We believe in hockey." I double-checked the TV listings at [Excite](http://www.excite.com). Yep, it was supposed to be on. I checked [nhl.com](http://www.nhl.com). Yep, they agreed that the game was supposed to be on OLN, and even gave an in-progress score. So what the heck was going on?

Next I did a Google search, and I found [this article](http://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/ny-spzip234394749aug23,0,7220593.column?coll=ny-sports-columnists) from [Newsday](http://www.newsday.com). It ends up that OLN is in a wrestling match with several major cable companies, apparently including my local provider, [Mediacom](http://www.mediacomcc.com). They want OLN to be a first-tier channel, i.e. have it included in the "standard" cable package that the company offers, rather than have it as part of a second-tier, pay-extra package. And so they are using blackouts of NHL games to try to blackmail the cable companies into switching around their cable packages.

The end result of all this: a whole bunch of really mad fans. Check out the [OLN forum](http://ww2.olntv.com/olnbb/index.php), for one. The funny part (OK, it's not so funny, maybe ironic?) is that the people that paid extra to get that second-tier so they could watch hockey are the exact ones that are getting screwed. No hockey for you! If I were Gary Bettman, I'd be getting pretty upset with OLN - why, after already almost killing your league with a cancelled season, would you want to further alienate your fan base by blacking out TV coverage and not explaining why?

I will be contacting all three parties to express my frustration. I doubt it'll accomplish anything, though. I should check... does some other network have TV rights for the Stanley Cup playoffs? If not, I may miss another whole season. Arrrrgh.
