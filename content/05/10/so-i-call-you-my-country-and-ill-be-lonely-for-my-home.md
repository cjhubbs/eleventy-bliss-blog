> And the coal trucks come a-runnin'  
> With their bellies full of coal  
> And their big wheels a-hummin'  
> Down this road that lies open like the soul of a woman  
> Who hid the spies who were lookin'  
> For the land of the milk and the honey  
> <br/>
> And this road she is a woman  
> She was made from a rib  
> Cut from the sides of these mountains  
>  Oh these great sleeping Adams  
> Who are lonely even here in paradise
> Lonely for somebody to kiss them
> and I'll sing my song, and I'll sing my song
> In the land of my sojourn
> <br/>
> And the lady in the harbor  
> She still holds her torch out  
> To those huddled masses who are  
> Yearning for a freedom that still eludes them  
> The immigrant's children see their brightest dreams shattered  
> <br/>
> Here on the New Jersey shoreline in the  
> Greed and the glitter of those high-tech casinos
> But some mendicants wander off into a cathedral  
> And they stoop in the silence  
> And there their prayers are still whispered
> And I'll sing their song, and I'll sing their song  
> In the land of my sojourn
> <br/>
> Nobody tells you when you get born here  
> How much you'll come to love it  
> And how you'll never belong here  
> So I call you my country  
> And I'll be lonely for my home  
> And I wish that I could take you there with me
> <br/>
> And down the brown brick spine of some dirty blind alley  
> All those drain pipes are drippin' out the last Sons Of Thunder  
> While off in the distance the smoke stacks  
> Were belching back this city's best answer  
> <br/>
> And the countryside was pocked
> With all of those mail pouch posters  
> Thrown up on the rotting sideboards of
> These rundown stables like the one that Christ was born in  
> When the old world started dying  
> And the new world started coming on  
> <br/>
> And I'll sing His song, and I'll sing His song  
> In the land of my sojourn

I was prompted by [Kari's piece](http://rmfo-blogs.com/karibeth/archives/2005/10/17/and-i-awoke-in-the-house-of-god/) the other day to revisit Rich Mullins' _A Liturgy, A Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band._ I have long counted this as one of my favorite albums, but it tends to be one of my forgotten favorites; I don't listen to it for a while, and then when I turn it on again, I wonder why I ever forgot about it.

I can't pick a favorite song of of this album, but the song I quoted here is one of the best. Rich nails the feelings that I have about the land where I live with these lines:

> Nobody tells you when you get born here How much you'll come to love it And how you'll never belong here So I call you my country And I'll be lonely for my home And I wish that I could take you there with me

Not much else to say about it... but if you haven't listened to this album for a while, get it back out. You won't be disappointed.
