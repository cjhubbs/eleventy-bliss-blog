This past weekend we were privileged to have [Dr. Gerry McDermott](http://www2.roanoke.edu/religion/mcdermott.htm) from [Roanoke College](http://web.roanoke.edu/) here with us in Cedar Rapids. Dr. McDermott's trip was sponsored by [Reconciliation Ministries](http://www.recminusa.org) and [Coe College](http://www.coe.edu). He spoke twice on Friday at Coe, and then on Saturday up at Troy Mills Christian Church in Troy Mills. Finally, he spoke at the morning services on Sunday at [Noelridge Park Church](http://www.noelridge.org). It was a busy weekend!

Dr. McDermott is a professor of Religion there at Roanoke, is a specialist on Jonathan Edwards, and has written something like eight books on a variety of religious topics. A recent article he wrote for Christianity Today, titled "Jesus and the Religions", can be found [here](http://www.ctlibrary.com/bc/2004/janfeb/4.09.html). Our connection here in Cedar Rapids to Dr. McDermott (let's just call him Gerry, he won't mind) is a personal one; he is a long-time friend of my pastor, Richard Marsceau. Richard was very excited to get him in here to speak.

Gerry's [first lecture at Coe](http://www2.roanoke.edu/religion/McDermott/franklinjefferson.htm) was a comparison and analysis of the religious views of three notable early American thinkers: Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Jonathan Edwards. It was quite good. The second lecture, which I was unable to attend, was provocatively titled "Was Jesus a Fundamentalist or a Liberal?". Apparently it drove some very good discussion regarding Jesus and who He claimed to be.

Friday night Richard invited me to join him, Gerry, and a Coe professor for dinner. I don't think I said more than a dozen words through the entire dinner, but had a wonderful time, listening to these guys discuss their spiritual journeys, current events, and views on religion. I felt somewhat out of my league, but I was learning a lot.

Saturday there was only a small gathering at Troy Mills to hear the discussion on Christians and homosexuality. It, too, was a good talk. I think it was helpful to those that attended. Gerry has been in the midst of the debate on homosexuality for some time now; he was an Episcopal priest for several years, and only recently left that church because of their liberal views. (He is now a pastor in the Lutheran church (ELCA).)

All of the folks that attended were invited to lunch afterwards, and again we had a good discussion. Later on it veered into theology, and we had a chance to discuss several views being debated in the Reformed church lately. (Gerry considers himself Reformed.) He recommended N.T. Wright's book _What St. Paul Really Said_ as an excellent read. I've heard it discussed, but haven't read it, so I went ahead and ordered a copy - actually, two copies; one for me, one for Richard. UPS should deliver them tomorrow. It will be an interesting read.

Sunday morning his message was on "True Religion". Again, good stuff. When I can dig out my notes, I'll summarize it here.

It's not often that I get the chance to participate in discussions and listen to lectures like I did this last weekend. It almost (only almost, mind you) makes me wish I were back in school, or participating in some grad school. But I don't think that's in the cards for any time too soon. So, I'll just take the time to enjoy weekends like this one.
