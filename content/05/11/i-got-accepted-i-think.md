I got a letter from the FAA today inviting me to the DER seminar down in Wichita in January. Strangely enough, I still haven't received a letter from them telling me that I've been accepted to come for an interview to become a DER. I'm hoping maybe that'll come yet this week some time. Exciting times! Now I'll have to get my books out and study some more for the interview. Gotta learn the alphabet soup that is our federal aviation regulations. :-)
