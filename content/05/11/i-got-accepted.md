Well, so I still haven't received the official "you're invited for an interview" letter from the FAA. However, I got a phone call yesterday from them, wanting to schedule my DER interview. It's gonna be in Wichita on December 13th at 9:00 AM.

I guess I should start studying up for the interview. I don't know how much they're gonna expect me to know, and how much it's just a chance to have them get a feel for me. Hopefully more of the latter than the former. :-)
