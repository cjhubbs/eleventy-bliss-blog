My first basketball league of the season starts tonight. I'm really looking forward to it. I know my shooting touch will be rusty; I haven't handled a basketball in months. But it will be good to get out there and run. I'm the captain of a team in the rec center league this year. I tried to just get on a team at the last minute; the league coordinator sent me the names of several other people with the same plight and so we formed a team. I haven't met any of them. We haven't practiced. But tonight, at 5:55 CST, we will step onto the court and play our first game. Good times.
