...and I had been planning on doing yard work. I did a little bit this morning (ran the mower on the front yard and filled up five and a half yard bags with leaves and such) but then it got nasty outside and Becky had a church event so I got to watch the kiddo for a while.

Since it's not so nice to work outside (and since Becky has my long extension cord at church, so I can't run the leaf blower), and since Laura is taking a nice nap, I decided it was a nice time to give the blog a facelift and watch football. So, Clemson is on TV beating Florida State, and I'm on the couch with the laptop working on the blog. Actually, it's about done for now.

I like lots of things about this theme. I think it's a big improvement over the old one. It was created by [Clemens Orth](http://clemens.orth.me.uk/), found by [Google](http://www.google.com), and tweaked by me. The only thing I'm not totally happy with at the moment is the font on the header graphic... it could be better. Maybe when I have some more time to be patient with photoshop, I'll give it another try.
