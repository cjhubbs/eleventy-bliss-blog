This holiday weekend we have left Iowa and headed to Wisconsin to visit my family. Thanksgiving with family is a great time; we have all of our traditional things to eat, games that we play, stories that get (re)told, time spent together. It is a blessing.

Last year when we came for Thanksgiving, Laura was just a 4-month-old baby. Now she's walking, talking, and generally the center of all our attention. Amazing.

The rest of the family is doing well, too. [Ryan](http://thehubbs.net/ryan/) generally works long hours and is very busy, which means that when he comes home he sleeps a _lot_. It's good for him. He's so darn funny, too... he keeps us in stitches most of the time. Last night as we were playing cards he made some slightly off-color comment; then he excused himself by noting that he has roomed with guys for the past several years, and, he said "we don't just push the envelope - the envelope is opened, soiled, and returned to sender!" OK, maybe it's not so funny in print, but last night we about had to stop our card game we were laughing so hard.

Aaron is the only one that isn't here; he's still in Panama working with YWAM. We miss him a lot. He called yesterday for about an hour so we all got to talk to him. He'll be back home for Christmas - hooray! It also sounds like he's planning on moving back to the States come next summer. It would be great to have him closer again.

We're about to head in to Madison to do some shopping. I know, we're crazy, but we all start to go a bit stir-crazy after being here at the house for a day and a half, so it's time to go out. Andrew had to work this morning at the lumberyard, but he'll meet us there once he gets off around noon. I doubt we'll even buy that much - maybe a new shirt, or a CD, or something in that vein. Mostly it's the chance to be out and around as a family. Holidays like this remind me that my family is the biggest blessing of all.
