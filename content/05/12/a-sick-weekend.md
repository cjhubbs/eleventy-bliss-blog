So Becky was sick on Friday... my turn came on Sunday. Nasty stomach bug. I hated to have to call the pastor and tell him that I couldn't be there, but I didn't have much choice. I didn't think we had anybody in town that could fill in on the piano.

What I found out later was that we had a visitor (OK, she'd visited several times) who happened to be there that morning who is an accomplished vocalist and pianist. She volunteered on the spot to play the piano and even stuck around to play for the second service! Praise God for providing.

I was feeling enough better last night to go to the church Christmas program and play/sing my part. I was/am still really tired, though. I slept about 3 hours during the day yesterday, then was asleep by 8:30 or so. I was feeling pretty good when I woke up this morning, but am starting to wear down now...

Well, I'll stop complaining. :-) Only three days of work this week, then begins the wonderful Christmas break! No work until 3 January 2006. Woohoo!
