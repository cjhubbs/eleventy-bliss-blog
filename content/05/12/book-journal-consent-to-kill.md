It follows the pattern set up in the previous books in the series, heck isn't this the pattern with all the books of this genre? Hero is a secret agent of some sort. Hero is wronged, wants to kill the bad guys. Gutless political leaders try but fail to prevent him from exacting vengance. End of story.

Saying that it follows a pattern isn't to say that it's a bad book; I enjoyed reading it. It's just not very original. I guess it's hard to be original these days.
