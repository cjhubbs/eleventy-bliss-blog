![Extreme Denial](http://www.audiobooksonline.com/shopsite/media/105821.gif) ![Assumed Identity](http://www.ereader.com/files/products/000/00/24/30/cover/medium.jpg)These two get grouped together since I read them both on the plane on my way to/from Wichita this week. Again, good entertainment. [Extreme Denial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446603961/002-2448287-7830465?v=glance&n=283155) and [Assumed Identity](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446600709/qid=1134697903/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-2448287-7830465?s=books&v=glance&n=283155) are just two of the multitude of titles by author [David Morrell](http://www.davidmorrell.net/). Probably best known for writing Rambo: First Blood, his later novels all centered around the idea of a secret agent-type (usually ex-Delta Force or ex-CIA) who effortlessly changes identities at will, and is either in the personal protection business or ends up operating that way.

I read one on the way down to Wichita, one on the way back. Good entertainment, fairly well written, but I couldn't read too many of them in a row... too similar, they'd start getting boring. So, I'll have to space them out over a while.
