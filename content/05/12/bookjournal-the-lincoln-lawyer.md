![The Lincoln Lawyer](http://www.michaelconnelly.com/The-Lincoln-Lawyer-Home-Pag.jpg)I just finished up my latest recreational read last night: [Michael Connelly](http://www.michaelconnelly.com/)'s _[The Lincoln Lawyer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=caedmonscalln-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0316734934%2526tag=caedmonscalln-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0316734934%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")_. I have been a fan of Mr. Connelly's Harry Bosch series for a while now, so I thought this was a safe bet.

_The Lincoln Lawyer_ ended up being a little less complex and thrilling than I had thought it might be. Lawyer with personal problems (but not too many personal problems) defends client who ends up being a really, really bad person. It was a nice change from the norm to have a hero who actually has a decent relationship with his ex-wife (we're actually left with a chance of them getting back together), and that doesn't have to solve the whole thing on his own; the police seem to do a reasonable job, and actually are one step ahead of the hero at the end of the book.

Oh the whole: a reasonable read, but nothing earthshattering or new and novel here. Well, OK, it is novel... **a** novel, that is. :-)
