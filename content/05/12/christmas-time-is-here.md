OK, so Christmas was actually two days ago. Now the family has all left for their respective homes and our house is quiet. It was a very nice Christmas. Laura is old enough this year to understand about opening presents and to really enjoy the toys she got. She could've just stopped with the first one... after 7 or 8 she was overwhelmed. We ended up leaving the last few of hers for her to open later.

I received many thoughtful gifts this year. In no particular order...

- Jamie Cullum's new CD, Chasing Tales
- Duke Ellington's 70th Birthday CD
- A cool t-shirt from Target - a spoof of the famous "Dogs at Cards", but with Snoopy and his pals playing poker. Actually, I got two of these.
- Two Family Christian Stores gift cards - the first will buy me [Derek Webb'](http://www.derekwebb.com)s _Mockingbird_, dunno what I'll get with the rest.
- Lemstone bookstore gift certificate
- Best Buy gift card
- Burger King gift card.... mmmmmm.... Whoppers.
- Some gift fundage from Becky's folks... I'm using this to buy the Adobe Photoshop Elements/Premiere Elements bundle pack I've had my eye on for a while.
- A bunch of misc sundries

I think that's it. My apologies to anybody if I forgot their gift.

Now I have the rest of the week off from work, so I'll have to find some projects to work on. Somehow I think I'd go crazy if I did nothing but sit and play on the computer all week. It wouldn't score many points with Becky, either. :-) So, I'm off now. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all!
