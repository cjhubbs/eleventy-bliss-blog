Joe Carter at The Evangelical Outpost has a very good post today titled ["Heuristics and Hyperbole: How Not to Argue (Part I)"](http://www.evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/001721.html). It's a well-written piece outlining how hyperbole should (and shouldn't) be used in arguments. It's worth reading. A few excerpts:

> An example of a rule of thumb that I find to be particularly useful in helping to avoid problems is to avoid, whenever possible, willfully stupid people. Intelligence is, of course, a relative concept and everyone (except for the Worldâ€™s Smartest Person) is just a little less bright than someone else. Willful stupidity, however, is distinct from IQ because it consists of a moral failing: Choosing to be dumber than you have to be.

and, a bit later:

> Metaphors work best when they are fresh, not when they are loud.
> 
> But even when the arguments fail to convince your audience honing your use of metaphorical language can aid in shaping your own thinking. Sloppy, trite arguments should be avoided not only because they are ineffective but because they encourage you to become a sloppy, trite thinker.

Go read the whole thing.
