...but that's only because today is my last day of work until January 3. Thank you [Uncle Rocky](http://www.rockwellcollins.com)! Not that my week-and-a-half off will be slow... but it'll be different. Christmas break is wonderful.

That being said, there should be a rule against reporting bad issues at work on the last day before break. But there's not. So this morning I get a call telling me that my project's software is crashing under a certain condition. Grrrr... It's just gonna have to wait until after Christmas.
