I have been attempting this afternoon to import some of my old blog\*spot posts. I was doing my best to set the dates, but it looks like WordPress is smarter than I am and is disallowing dates older than when it was installed. I'll have to attempt some geekery to get around it. Just thought I'd let you know.

Carry on.
