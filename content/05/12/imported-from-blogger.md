OK, I finally got my import from Blogger to Wordpress working. I followed the [handy hints at the Wordpress Support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/42015), and found a modified script that ran the import OK. You can find it at [http://alittlebitleft.com/import-blogger.phps](http://alittlebitleft.com/import-blogger.phps). Note that you'll have to click on that link, then copy and paste the text into a file called import-blogger.php.

So now if you're a reader and really bored, you can go read my old posts from last November and December. Hard to believe I've been blogging for more than a year now! I know, that still means I'm a newbie compared to some of you. :-)
