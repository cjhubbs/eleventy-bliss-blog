Last night Becky asked a question that seemed like it should have a simple answer: how could we create an online map that shows several different locations all at the same time? She is planning our church's Christmas caroling, and wanted to be able to map all the possible locations we'd go so we could see how they're grouped geographically and how we might best choose a route to them all.

First stop: [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com). Unfortunately, they don't appear to have any built-in easy way to map multiple user-defined locations.

Second stop: Google search for "map multiple locations". I found several links that gave me info on how I could use the API that Google Maps makes available to create a Google map with more than one location. But that was more work than I really wanted to have to deal with last night.

Third stop: another Google search led me to communitywalk.com. CommunityWalk is still in beta testing, but it does exactly what I wanted it to: I could type in addresses, it would mark them on the map, allow me to edit data about each address, and would even show me directions between different addresses. They're using Google Maps as their back-end. Their UI is obviously still under development, but it worked fine for what I was wanting it to do.

If you're curious about my map, you can see it at [http://communitywalk.com/map/1269](http://communitywalk.com/map/1269). I will likely find myself coming back to use this site again.
