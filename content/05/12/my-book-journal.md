I read voraciously. Sometimes really good books, sometimes just so-so books that I read for the escapism and entertainment. Talking with Richard the other day, I got the idea that I should keep a journal of all the books I read. The only rule is that I can't write about 'em until I finish them, which should maybe help motivate me to finish the few half-read books sitting next to my bed. At least that's the idea. I have a feeling I'll be troubled by how many so-so books I read, but, we'll see.
