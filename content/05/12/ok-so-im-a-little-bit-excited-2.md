Tomorrow the Andrew Peterson Behold the Lamb Christmas tour is hitting Cedar Rapids! I couldn't believe it when I first heard about it months ago, and I'm still a bit in awe of the fact that Andrew Peterson, Derek Webb, Sandra McCracken, Andrew Osenga, Jill Phillips, and some others will all be in concert on stage less than 3 miles from my house. (Only 1 block away from the previous place we lived!)

In addition to just going to the concert, I've volunteered to help out for the day. I'm showing up at 10 AM when the truck shows up, and then will be the "runner" for the day. This will include taking all the aforementioned musical types to their hotel, to the house where they're eating dinner, etc. I think it'll be pretty cool.

I'm also looking forward to just getting to meet some of them; I've met the Andys before (Peterson and Osenga), but haven't met Derek or Sandra. I hope it'll be as cool as I think it will be.... if not, at least I'll get to see the concert, and that'll be great in itself. I'll try to post some pictures or something next week.
