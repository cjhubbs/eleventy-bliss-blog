"Strong people of faith are not defined by what they do for a living but, rather, how they live what they do." -- [Len Pasquarelli](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=2268643), describing Tony Dungy

A remarkable observation. Sympathies and prayers to the Dungy family on the loss of their son.
