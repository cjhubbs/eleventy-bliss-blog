A great column from Jonah Goldberg from a week ago, but it just ran in my print newspaper today.

> Among the proud recipients of _Time_ magazine's fluffy end-of-year "People Who Mattered" feature is Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Here's how his blurb begins: "He is an unlikely firebrand: the soft-spoken son of a blacksmith who still sometimes drives a 30-year-old Peugeot. But Iran's new President doesn't shrink from controversy. After winning a disputed election, he said . . ." Now, before I finish that sentence, let's at least note that so far _Time_ is using the same tone it might use to talk about John McCain, Joe Wilson, George Clooney, or some other "soft-spoken" "unlikely firebrand" beloved by the media. (_Time_ has referred to both Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sen. Joe Lieberman as "unlikely firebrands"as well. To date neither has proposed genocide.)
> 
> So, does Ahmadinejad have a wacky blog? Did he admit on _Larry King Live_ that he voted for Ralph Nader in 2000? What makes him such a charming rogue?
> 
> Let's pick up that sentence where we left off and see: "After winning a disputed election," _Time_ reports, "he said he would continue Iran's nuclear program, called the Holocaust a 'myth' and pledged to destroy Israel. Even some of the nation's ruling clerics are nervous about what he will do next." So even some of Iran's terrorism-supporting theocratic dictators are "nervous" about this guy.
> 
> What, one wonders, would it take for the editors to get really rough? Perhaps if Ahmadinejad offered a deeply negative review of _Brokeback Mountain_?
> 
> _Time_ describes Pope Benedict XVI as perhaps "too polarizing a conservative." But for Ahmadinejad, who declared that a member nation of the U.N. should be "wiped off the map" and that the touchstone moral horror of modernity was nothing but a "myth" . . . well, let's make sure to bring up that he drives an old Peugeot. That's a crucial fact. If only we could find out what kind of tree he would be if he could be a tree. Maybe next year.

> I know what you're thinking, but this isn't a jab at liberal media bias — though we can have that argument if you like. Rather, this points to something deeper: the resurgence of American isolationism.
> 
> Few issues are more shrouded in myth and misunderstanding than isolationism. Even as the "come home, America" chorus grows louder on the left, we're still told that isolationism is a right-wing phenomenon. This myth starts with the Republican party's rejection of the Treaty of Versailles, which didn't really have much to do with isolationism. The Republican party — the party of Teddy Roosevelt, after all — was full of interventionists and hawks. And the Democratic party had plenty of isolationists and doves.
> 
> In the 1930s, isolationism was respectable across the ideological spectrum. Norman Thomas — the president of the American Socialist party — was an isolationist. Oswald Garrison Villard (former editor of the _Nation_), Charles Beard, John Dewey, Bernard Baruch, and countless other liberal luminaries were isolationists of varying intensity.
> 
> John F. Kennedy sent the isolationist America First Committee $100 while he was at Harvard with the note, "what you are doing is vital." But that was the same JFK who wrote _Why England Slept_ — his senior thesis-cum-bestseller on why Britain was unready for war. Kennedy's explanation: The British people were unwilling to face reality. The same was true of the United States in the 1930s. The memory of the horror and stupidity of World War I was fresh enough in Americans' minds — as was the ongoing Depression — that the idea of going to war or even engaging in world affairs just seemed unthinkable. So, we didn't think about it. We used language that made things seem okay.
> 
> But the problem, as Kennedy learned, is that evil men and dangerous forces don't take a timeout until we're ready to pay attention. And that's where Iran comes in. Seriously challenging Iran just strikes a lot of people as too much to fit on the American plate right now, so we prefer to call Ahmadinejad an "unlikely firebrand" instead of a murderous fanatic.
> 
> But whatever we call him, it won't change the fact that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons and that Ahmadinejad is a particularly kooky religious fanatic (possibly a member of the Hojjatieh, which seeks to foment global chaos in order to hasten the arrival of the messianic 12th imam).
> 
> In response to Ahmadinejad's comments, the world has responded with only slightly more outrage than it would if he'd called for trade barriers on pistachios. It's time to wake up.
