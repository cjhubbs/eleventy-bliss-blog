It's been feeling like Christmas the last couple of weeks, what with the sub-zero temps and the foot of snow we've gotten over the last 10 days. Tonight we got the Christmas tree put up. We've actually had it since Tuesday, but finally had a chance today to get it decorated and lit up. Actually, in this picture, it's only about half-done - Becky's still working on the tinsel, and we still have a mess of needles to clean up on the floor.

The excitement that went along with it was Laura throwing up twice. Hopefully it was just something she ate and not the stomach flu that's going around... :-(

Tomorrow I head off to Wichita for my DER interview. If you think about it, say a prayer for me... the interview's at 9 AM on Tuesday. I'll let you all know how I did.

That's all the news from the Hubbs' world, where the women are strong, the women are good-looking, and the child is definitely above average. :-)
