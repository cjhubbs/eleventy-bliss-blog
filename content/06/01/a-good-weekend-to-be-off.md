Yesterday was my first Sunday of just taking a break from leading the worship team. David Green did a very respectable job in my absence. The Lord used this weekend to remind me once again that His plans are so much better than mine. He knew I would need this weekend off.

Laura was difficult all weekend. It's not really her fault; she's teething, which makes her cranky anyway. It was combined with a cold this time (a cold that I have too), so in addition to the drooling, her sinuses are perpetually clogged, and she's been running a 103 degree fever. Tylenol or Motrin will bring the fever down for a few hours and turn her back into her bubbly self, but about 4 hours into the 6-hour dosage, the fever comes back and she gets owly again. She's not sleeping well, either; she's been in our bed the last two nights, which is a last resort for us. We don't sleep well with her in the bed; she's a restless sleeper and snores. However, it's better to lose sleep to a snoring baby in your bed than to a crying baby in the other room.

Sunday I made it up in time to get to the second wervice at church, so I did get to hear the sermon and the worship team. Like I said, they were pretty good, David's got a good musical sense. Mostly they were just lacking a clear leader. Somebody on the WT has to know where you're going, when you're going there, and then just grab everybody and take them along. That just takes practice, and time doing it. As long as people are willing, I'll be happy to provide them opportunities to practice, and any coaching that I can do along the way.

Now it's Monday. Becky reports that Laura is still feeling bum this morning. Please, Lord, can this teething get done with?
