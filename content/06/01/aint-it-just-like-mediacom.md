It's not unusual, in my experience, to receive calendars as gifts around Christmas-time from companies you do business with. We always get a desk calendar from our insurance agent which fits nicely on the desk downstairs. We receive a pretty one with Bible verses and inspirational sayings from a missions agency that we support. We got one from the Christian radio station this year that had pictures taken by listeners. Kinda cool. I'm sure we got a couple of others as well, I know we gave a Norman Rockwell one away to my Dad.

This year we also got one from our cable provider, Mediacom. It was rather audaciously titled "12 months of You", but it appeared to be more like 12 months of them. There were a few coupons inside for free pay-per-view movies (which we never watch), and then the artwork for each month featured one of their cable channels. Color me less than excited.

But that wasn't the best part. You see, most gift calendars come in late November or early December. Mediacom's came on **January 27th**. January 27th! Apparently their 12 months of me is really only about 11 months... Unbelievable.

The Mediacom calendar is sitting in the recycle bin on my curb this morning, waiting to be picked up by the garbage man. Good riddance.
