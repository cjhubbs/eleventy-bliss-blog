I'm sitting here at work with a stream from C-Span playing the Senate Judiciary committee hearing of Judge Samuel Alito.

Question 1: Why the heck do they call it a "hearing" when the senators do so much more talking than the nominee does?

I'm getting really tired of listening to all of the speeches. Right now Joe Biden is in the middle of what will be at least a 7-minute speech regarding how Judge Alito will be replacing the woman who was the "fulcrum" on the court - the swing vote on a lot of issues. Senator Biden, a couple of words for you: shut up and let the nominee say something.
