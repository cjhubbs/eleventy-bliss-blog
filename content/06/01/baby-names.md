OK, so Becky is due with kiddo #2 the first week of March. We've talked baby names a little bit, but really haven't gotten anywhere. We had an easy time with kiddo #1... we got to Laura and both went "yeah, that's it!". We had semi-agreement on a boy's name if she'd been a boy, but I wasn't totally keen on the middle name.

So I figure, what the heck, I have readers, right? Leave me ideas. Any boys or girls name suggestions? No promises that we'll use any of 'em, but if we do, I'll have to send you a prize or something.
