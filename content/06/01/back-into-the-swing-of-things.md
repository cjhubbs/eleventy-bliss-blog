Today I'm back at work after 11 days of holiday. I was just about ready to come back... I can only spend so much time away from routines before it starts to drive me crazy.

So I'm sitting at work today, but with some Christmas gifts to entertain me; right now I'm listening to (and quite enjoying) [Jamie Cullum](http://www.jamiecullum.com)'s new album _Catching Tales_. It's a nice mix of jazz and pop, very listenable. I also have listened through Switchfoot's new album _Nothing Is Sound_, though it was a bit of a pain getting it onto my iPod with the copy protection Sony put in place on the CD. (Quick solution: rip the files with [CDex](http://www.download.com/CDex/3000-2140_4-10226370.html?tag=pdp_prod), then import them into iTunes.)

Finally, the last bit of fun for now: Becky IM'd me from home a little while ago to let me know that my copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0/Premiere Elements 2.0 came from Amazon today. Oh, the fun I will have photo and video editing...
