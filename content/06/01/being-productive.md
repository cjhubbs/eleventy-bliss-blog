Last night Becky was gone to a baby shower at the church, and so after I put Laura to bed around 7 I had a couple of hours to myself. As tempting as it was to sit down and watch _Month Python & the Holy Grail_ (which Becky hates and I haven't watched in a long time), I decided to get some useful stuff done.

Who'd believe how much you can get done in 90 minutes? I got the dishes done, got most of our income tax stuff figured out (thanks to TurboTax... now we're just waiting for my W2 and we can file), and got stuff coordinated for worship team this weekend. And I still had time to turn on a movie that was on the Tivo that I thought I might like. It ended up being kinda boring, so I ignored it.

Tonight I have free again. I think I'll do some playing with Photoshop and maybe we'll watch some movie we can agree upon. Either that or we'll start watching the American Idol auditions... that should be good for a laugh or two.

Oh, I should also add a comment about a new TV show we watched last night - it's called _[Hustle](http://hustle.amctv.com/)_ and it airs on [AMC](http://www.amctv.com/). It's produced by the BBC, and the best way to describe it is as _Ocean's 11_ in a one-hour show. I'm looking forward to seeing a few more episodes... the first one was pretty good.
