![Fortunes of War](http://www.stephencoonts.com/published_titles/graphics/fortunespb.jpg)[Fortunes of War](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312185839/ref=ed_oe_h/104-8218230-2982340?%5Fencoding=UTF8) is a recent title from [Stephen Coonts](http://www.stephencoonts.com). It is in many respects a standard military adventure novel, but it is based on an interesting premise. What if a newly militarized Japan tried to seize Siberia from a weakened Russia? How would the world respond? What might happen?

From there the action is good enough to make it a decent read. The story focuses on two fighter pilots, one American, one Japanese, who are friends but end up fighting on opposite sides. The story almost wraps up a little too quickly and neatly; I was left wishing for something a little less formulaic.

Now, maybe I'm a hard audience to please; Red Storm Rising has always been my benchmark of a good war novel. Sure, it's long, and has a gazillion plot threads, and is (like all of Tom Clancy's stuff) overly technical, but that's the way I like 'em. As much as I wish Clancy and/or Bond's writing schedule would accellerate a bit, I'll take their epics over the consistent (but formulaic) offerings from Coonts any day.
