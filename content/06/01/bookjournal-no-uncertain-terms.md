Well I just about have this one finished up so I'll write about it now. [William Safire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire), in addition to having been for many years the conservative political columnist for the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com), is also the author of the "On Language" column that ran in that paper on Sundays for many years. In "On Language", Mr. Safire explored the origin of words and phrases, discusses usage and spelling, and generally addressed any other language-related topic that piqued his interest. _No Uncertain Terms_ is a recent (perhaps the latest... I'm not quite certain) collection of those "On Language" columns, one of at least a dozen. I know I own at least one more of the set: _In Love With Norma Loquendi_.

Being a lover of words and turns of phrase, Safire's columns fascinate me. ALmost better than the columns, though, are the responses he chooses to print. Many of his readers choose to write in, enough that he has given the various groups titles. There's the "Gotcha! Gang", which nails him on factual errors. (I was actually a member of this gang once several years ago.) Then there's the "Squad Squad", nailing redundancy at every turn. Safire often corresponds with professors of English, editors of dictionaries, and historians, which means that the level of learnedness is very high. Still, the writing is snappy, so the book stays fun, and rarely gets dull.

I doubt I'll find and add all of Safire's collections to my personal library, but I'll be on the lookout for another volume or two. They are fun reading, the topics won't get old, _and_ they improve my grammar and usage.
