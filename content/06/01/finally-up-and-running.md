It's taken too long, but [noelridge.org](http://www.noelridge.org) is finally up and running with real pictures of our people and a color scheme that's much more readable than the old light green. Now there's just regular maintenance to do... but that's fairly easy.

This task has been on my list of stuff to finish for far too long now, so it's good to get it done.
