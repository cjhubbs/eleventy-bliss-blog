No, [Geof](http://ijsm.org/archives/category/geekery/gtd/), I haven't read [the book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/), and this isn't about the book. However, it has been nice lately to get some things done.

I've had the [Noelridge Park Church](http://www.noelridge.org) website sitting incomplete for several months now. I just needed to get some photos taken, but had never gotten it done. I got the pictures taken and sent them in on Monday. Soon we will be updated and ready to go. Phew!

In addition, tonight I will be getting things scheduled such that I have the first of what will be regular weeks off from leading the worship team. I need the break. I'm very thankful to the Lord for bringing in other musicians who can share the load.

There have been a bunch of other little things recently that haven't been big notable items, but just things that have been on the waiting list for a while and now are getting completed. It's a good feeling. It's also probably timely; come the beginning of March I'll have other things to keep me busy. :-)
