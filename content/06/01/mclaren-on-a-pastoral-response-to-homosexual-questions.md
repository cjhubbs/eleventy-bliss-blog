There's been a fascinating discussion going on over on the [Out of Ur blog](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/outofur/) the past few days.

First: [Brian McLaren on the Homosexual Question: Finding a Pastoral Response](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/outofur/archives/2006/01/brian_mclaren_o.html). Then: [A Blogger's Response](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/outofur/archives/2006/01/brian_mclaren_o_1.html). Next: [A Prologue and Rant by Mark Driscoll](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/outofur/archives/2006/01/brian_mclaren_o_2.html). (zing!) And last, but not least, [McLaren's response](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/outofur/archives/2006/01/brian_mclaren_o_3.html).

If you're at all interested in the question of how the church addresses homosexuality, I'd recommend you read them all.
