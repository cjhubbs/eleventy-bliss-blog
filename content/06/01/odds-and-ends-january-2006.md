I've been a bit haphazard in my posting habits lately, so I'll just dump a bunch of stuff in here in lieu of a real post. I've been reading lots of stuff lately, just not posting. I'll have to make that change.

I'm headed to Wichita tomorrow for my DER orientation. It's just a one-day session, so I'll be on the late flight home tomorrow (back to CID at 10:04 PM). So beginning on Thursday, I will officially be a DER Candidate and can start reviewing stuff and recommending approval of TSO items. It's a fairly significant new chapter in my career here.

Next topic: congratulations to my friends Lee & Amber Adams on the birth of their daughter Adi Grace early Sunday morning! Adi is their first, and I'm sure they will soon come to find just how wonderful daughters are. :-) Now we just need to take a trip down to see them sometime...

Next topic: Last night was the talent show at [church](http://www.noelridge.org). I did two songs, opening the show with [Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com)'s _Susan Coats' Pants_ and finishing up the show with [Andy Gullahorn](http://www.andygullahorn.com)'s _Holy Flakes_. Becky noted afterwards that most people's response to the former was "huh?" She said it's mostly a "Chris song", which I think means that my weird sense of humor appreciates it, but most (normal) people won't. Oh well, that's what talent shows are for. The most frequent question after the talent show was "where do you find these songs?" I take great pleasure in knowing that I can dig up songs that nobody's heard of but that people really like. Of course, I really only get away with it because I'm the only one at the church that listens to all of the [Square Peg](http://www.squarepegalliance.com/) types.

I guess that's it for now. I promise I'll try to write a sensible post soon.
