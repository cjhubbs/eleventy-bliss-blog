[Andy Osenga notes today](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/01/20/ps-itunes-help/) that [Ben Shive](http://www.benshive.com) is going to release his own album. No word yet on when this will happen (Andy intimates maybe sometime this year), but [Ben's website](http://www.benshive.com) announcing that fact is funny enough to make it worth the read.

Don't know who Ben Shive is? For shame! The man is a genius, I tell you. Genius.
