We had our first WT practice in about a month on Wednesday night. It was good to get back to it. I don't know what was up on Wednesday, whether I turned the monitors up higher than usual, or what, but we sounded _really good_ vocally. Harmonies were tight. Everybody sounded nice and even and balanced. What a nice sound. I'm looking forward to Sunday... hopefully we accomplish something similar then. Hate to leave your best stuff on the bullpen mound in warmups. But the glory goes to God either way.

One of the good things that's come out of [my sickness over Christmas](/05/12/a-sick-weekend/) and [my efforts to weed out my schedule](/05/10/priorities-of-time/) has been several people coming forward to help out with leading the worship team. For much of the six years I've led the team, it's been hard to line someone up for just the occasional Sunday I had to be gone. (Just a few times a year!) But things are changing. One woman who has attended for a long while and has led worship other places in the past wanted to start participating. So we got her involved. Now the gal who volunteered at a moment's notice when I was sick back in December has indicated she'd like to be available to fill in from time to time. And then earlier this week our bass player (a phenomenal all-around musician) said he'd really like to lead some services and he could do that playing either the bass or the piano. Praise God for his supply!

I distributed a WT schedule for the next two months that includes me having one Sunday off each month and another Sunday where we are more informal and don't have a WT. (That was the pastor's idea, not mine... but I don't mind it.) We'll see how it plays out, but I think this is the start of some easing off of my WT load... and that will be very nice.
