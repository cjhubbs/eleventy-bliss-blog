[Mark T](http://foolishsage.com/) [provides a link](http://foolishsage.com/archives/2006/02/27/enns-a-theology-ofsports/) to a wonderful article by Dr. Peter Enns titled ["Loving Christ While I Cheer for the Yankees"](http://www.byfaithonline.com/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID323422%7CCHID664014%7CCIID2172430,00.html). While I'll have to forgive Dr. Enns for cheering for the Yankees, he has some really good thoughts on how we fit our enjoyment of sports into a theological framework.

Worth reading if you're a sports fan, or want to understand a sports fan a little bit better.
