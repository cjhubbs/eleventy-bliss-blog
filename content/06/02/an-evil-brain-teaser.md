[Geof](http://www.gfmorris.net) posted this over on the [Rumor Forum](http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/) and it's been so much fun I thought I'd share it with everybody. (Geof promises his solution tomorrow.)

**Question:**

An aircraft is on a runway. This runway is outfitted with a conveyor belt that has the capability to _exactly_ match the speed of the aircraft landing gear's wheels. Can the plane take off? Why or why not?
