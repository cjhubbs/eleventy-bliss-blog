Tomorrow night I'm providing two hours of musical entertainment at my favorite coffeeshop. I'll admit to being a little bit nervous, but I imagine it'll turn out OK. I'm planning on doing about half instrumental stuff and half vocal stuff.

If any of you are in the Cedar Rapids area and want to come, here's the details:

[Brewed Awakenings Coffeehouse](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com) 1271 1st Ave SE, Cedar Rapids Friday February 10 8:00 - 10:00 PM

Should be a good time!
