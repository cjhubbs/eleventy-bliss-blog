[Fear, Complexity, Environmental Management in the 21st Century](http://www.michaelcrichton.com/speeches/complexity/complexity.html)

This is a must-read article by Michael Crichton. His basic premise: we can make statistics say about anything, and so the trend is that the media and other organizations will try to build a big fear of a crisis. In reality, the environmental cycles are fairly normal. His conclusion:

> Is this really the end of the world? Earthquakes, hurricanes, floods?  
> <br/>
> No, we simply live on an active planet. Earthquakes are continuous, a million and a half of them every year, or three every minute. A Richter 5 quake every six hours, a major quake every 3 weeks. A quake as destructive as the one in Pakistan every 8 months. It’s nothing new, it’s right on schedule.  
> <br/>
> At any moment there are 1,500 electrical storms on the planet. A tornado touches down every six hours. We have ninety hurricanes a year, or one every four days. Again, right on schedule. Violent, disruptive, chaotic activity is a constant feature of our globe.  
> <br/>
> Is this the end of the world? No: this is the world.  
> <br/>
> It’s time we knew it.
