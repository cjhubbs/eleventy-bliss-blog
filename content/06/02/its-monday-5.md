...and I haven't posted since last Wednesday, which means I'm a real slacker. I fall into this basic pattern of blogging where I show up on Monday, realize I'm a slacker, then because I have nothing more thoughtful to post, post a weekend update. Yawn. But since I've already fooled you into reading this far, here was my weekend:

Friday night Becky and I went and saw _King Kong_ at the [cheap theater](http://www.collinsroadtheatres.com). It was worth seeing on the big screen. It was pretty over-the-top; Peter Jackson would get you squirming, and then when you thought it should be about done, he'd make you squirm for another 10 seconds. The plot/story was OK, but pretty basic. The one part I really liked was the way the shots at the top of the Empire State Building were done; they had me fearing the heights even though I was safe in my seat. Well done that.

Saturday morning I headed over to Mount Vernon to accompany a young man from church who was trying out for a voice scholarship at [Cornell College](http://www.cornellcollege.edu). It was fun to be on a college campus again, and even more fun to be on one that had good music facilities. If I were on campuses too often, I could definitely get bit by the college bug again and think about studying up enough that I could go back and teach. Sounds fun, but I think it's unlikely.

Played a church league basketball game on Saturday and then headed home. Took Becky and Laura out for dinner and did a little shopping. Oh, and Becky's mom headed home Saturday morning. It was great to have her visit, she was a big help to Becky, and she and Laura had soooo much fun.

Sunday led worship as usual at both services. We were without practice this week, which left us a little bit rough, but it turned out OK. That was about it for Sunday. Stayed home, just a lazy afternoon.

Now we're to Monday and another week. It's not too exciting so far. If it gets exciting, I'll be sure to post about it.
