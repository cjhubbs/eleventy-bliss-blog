Just to tie up a few loose ends from previous posts:

1) The [evening at the coffeehouse](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/02/09/coffeehouse-time/) went well. I ended up doing a little more instrumental and a little less vocal than I had originally planned, since the place was so full and noisy during the first hour that any attempt at capturing their attention for a vocal would've been a disaster. Still, I got to sing some, got to play a bunch, and even got some tips! Good times.

2) [Geof](http://www.ijsm.org) hasn't posted the answer on his blog yet, but he declares (and I agree with him) that the answer to the [evil brain teaser](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/02/10/an-evil-brain-teaser/) is that yes, the airplane will fly, since the engines are pushing against the air, and the air is unaffected by the conveyor belt. So kudos to [Aaron](http://thehubbs.net/aaron/), who almost immediately came to the right answer.

Well that's about all the news from the home front for today. Becky's mom is here to spend the week, we've been having fun with her, and also we're enjoying having a babysitter for the week! :-) We went and saw _The Producers_ at the theatre on Saturday (good old cheesy Mel Brooks - gotta love it!) and we'll probably go out again either tomorrow or Thursday, kind of a last-chance date before the baby is born. Officially there's about 2 more weeks left... I guess we'll take it a day at a time.
