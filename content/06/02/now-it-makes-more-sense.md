Emanuele Ottolenghi, who teaches at Oxford Uninversity, writes a [column](http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/ottolenghi200602060945.asp) today on [National Review Online](http://www.nationalreview.com) that makes a crucial connection between some recent Islamic dots.

Much has been in the [news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4684652.stm) the past week or so of the unrest caused by Muslims in response to some cartoons published in a Danish newspaper that ridiculed Mohammed. Much fury has been unleashed at Denmark, including the torching of its mission in Lebanon and its embassy in Syria.

Given that Syria is a very tightly-run country, Ottolenghi draws the reasonable conclusion that the protests aren't as "spontaneous" as we might be led to believe. And then he makes this connection:

> Could it be that, as David Conway of [Civitas suggests](http://www.civitas.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/02/if_theres_hell_below_is_this_where_we_shall_all_be_spending_xmas_.html#more), this has little to do with Muhammad the Prophet and much to do with Iran the nuclear power? Iran, after all, has just been refereed to the U.N. Security Council on account of its nuclear program. And guess what: When Iran finds itself in the eye of the storm, which, of all countries, will be chairing the U.N. body? Denmark.

And suddenly it makes sense. Denmark is serving a term on the Security Council, and [will hold the presidency of the Security Council in June 2006](http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/unsc_members.html), which would be around a reasonable timeframe that the Security Council might take up the issues with Iran.

It makes sense to me. And it's scary.
