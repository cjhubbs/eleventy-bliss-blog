[I saw Anthony Burger perform at the Moody Pastor's Conference](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2005/05/24/moody-conference-day-2/) last year in May. His style wasn't my favorite, but the man could play the piano, and knew how to put on a good show. His style made more sense, though, when I saw him on TV with the Gaithers.

I was suprised and saddened to read yesterday that he has died at the young age of 44. He collapsed while performing; the assumption right now is that it was a heart attack.

My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. What a comfort to know that he is rejoicing with the Savior today.
