We haven't had much snow this winter; we had about 16 inches in December, but then we've had nothing since December 16. It's really kind of a bummer. I like the snow.

The current forecast, though, has 6 to 9 inches slated for Eastern Iowa tomorrow. Woohoo! And it's another chance to use [the new snowblower](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2005/12/16/just-for-the-record/)... :-)

I'll keep my fingers crossed.
