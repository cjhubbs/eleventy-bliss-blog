I didn't think it would ever be possible, but at the moment, I feel like I have too much new music to handle.

Within the past week, I have accumulated six new CDs:

- A fabulous mix CD from [Susan](http://rmfo-blogs.com/graceycat/) as part of the RMFO Mix CD Circle.
- A pretty darn good mix CD from Chris in Houston from the previous RMFO Mix CD Circle. It's a little bit harder stuff than what I'd usually listen to, but there's still some quite good stuff there.
- [In The Company of Angels: The World Will Sing](http://www.inthecompanyofangels2.com), the latest offering from [Caedmon's Call](http://www.caedmonscall.com). I got the pre-release for worship leaders as I noted in [my previous post](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/02/21/in-the-company-of-angels-the-world-will-sing/). I've listened through it 3 or 4 times so far.
- The Builder & The Architect, from [Sandra McCracken](http://www.sandramccracken.com)
- Beams of Heaven: Indelible Grace 4
- Indigo Girls - I picked this up for three bucks at the used bookstore.

My excuse for the last two is that I'm looking for some good hymns to add to our repertoire at church. And the Caedmon's disk was an unexpected freebie, so that's not too bad. But I just feel like I don't have the time to really dig in and give this music the time it deserves. I guess I'll have to cut down on the CD buying for a while. (Did I say that?)
