No, it's not the baby. But today we did end up purchasing a nice used minivan. It's a 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan, has about 70000 miles on it. Got a pretty good price and traded in (!) my old Toyota Corolla that was on its last legs. Laura seems to really enjoy riding in it, and it'll have lots of room for us and our stuff especially after we add kiddo #2.

I'll try to get some pictures in the next few days. Today it was raining so it was hard to get any.

Still waiting for the baby, I'll be sure to keep you posted on that. :-)
