I placed an order today for some music that I've dreamed about playing for a long time: [Claude Bolling's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bolling) [Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006329Y/sr=8-4/qid=1143170448/ref=sr_1_4/103-1345266-4767068?%5Fencoding=UTF8). (The link is to the audio CD so you can listen to samples. I ordered the sheet music.) This is some phenomenal jazz/classical/whatever-the-heck-it-is fusion. I dunno when I first heard it - sometime in high school, I suppose, and immediately I wished I could get with a trio and play it. But that seemed unlikely and the folio with the instrumental parts cost about 50 bucks.

Flash forward to today. I was looking online for a decent collection of Debussy piano music, and while browsing, came across the Bolling suite again. I decided that I could now manage the 45 bucks, so I ordered it. I also know a couple good flute players and a really good bass player, so I might just be able to get a little trio together to work some of it up. I know I'll need to get practicing on it - it's some challenging stuff. But I'm excited to just give it a shot.
