The server has been down for the last few days, so I haven't been able to update. But now it's back and running, so here goes. Actually, there isn't a whole lot to update about.

Becky and Addison came home from the hospital on Wednesday. We are slowly getting sleep schedules adjusted and Addison is sleeping decently at night.

I had already planned on taking the whole week off, and what better weekend to take off than the opening weekend of March Madness? I will confess to having watched far too many basketball games this weekend. There were some good ones. I was disappointed when the Hawkeyes lost their first-round game on a miracle shot, but hey, if you leave the door open...

Saturday morning I had a very minor sore throat; I was feeling pretty tired, but wrote that off to the wacky sleep schedules this week. By Sunday morning that very minor sore throat became a very major sore throat. Thankfully I already had someone lined up to lead worship for me. So instead of going to church, I headed off to MercyCare North, where the doctor took one look at my throat and just shook his head. He did a throat swab for strep and when the result came back and the "Yes" field had four stars in it and was circled, well, I don't think I was suprised.

So I'm home again today. I really was ready to get back to work. Becky, don't take that wrong when you read this. :-) I've logged on to the work computer here from home to respond to some email and such, but I'm sure things are just piling up there waiting for me, and I'm ready to get going on it. Maybe tomorrow. The doctor says I should be non-contagious by then. So then if I'm only feeling up to it... The other real bummer is that being still-contagious right now, I have to try to avoid too much contact with the rest of the family... and it's hard to be home with Laura and not want to spend time playing with her.

Well, that's my whine for the day. :-)
