Michael Spencer (aka iMonk) has a nice little series over at [internetmonk.com](http://www.internetmonk.com) entitled "Postcards to a Young Theologian". There's some good stuff there for theologians of all ages. It's primarily aimed at Calvinists, but there's stuff there for everybody.

[Part 1](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/postcards-to-a-young-calvinist-1): Introduction.

[Part 2](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/postcards-to-a-young-theologian): Be suspicious of guilt that comes from crossing the perceived boundaries of a group.

[Part 3](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/postcards-to-a-young-theologian-3): Be honest: Does the logic of a group eventually conclude that other Christians are, in fact, not true believers at all?

Worth the time to read.
