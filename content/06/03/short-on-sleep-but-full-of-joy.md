Yesterday welcomed our little girl Addison Grace into the world. It was a quick labor and delivery; we were at the hospital for a whole 45 minutes or so before she was born. :-) She's a big girl (9 lbs 3 oz) and seems to be doing well. She's had a stuffy nose, but otherwise has been happy to just eat, sleep, and fill diapers. Ahhh, the life of a newborn. :-)

She was born at 3:12 AM on the 13th, so we didn't get much sleep that night. Slept a little better here at the hospital last night. Not the most comfortable bed, but at least we could go to sleep by 9 and sleep until 7 or later with few interruptions.

Laura doesn't know quite what to do with the baby yet; I don't think it's quite registered that it's _our_ baby... it'll be interesting to see how it goes when we all get home tomorrow.

Well that's about it for now. I'll post some more later.
