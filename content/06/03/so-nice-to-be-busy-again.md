Things had been a little bit slow at work for the past couple of weeks; I was winding up one project and in a holding pattern waiting for some critical decisions to be made so I could start the next project. Work is amazingly long and excruciating when you're bored.

But the decision got made yesterday, and I am off and running on the new project. Yesterday flew by. So much to do! Today is moving at a brisk pace as well. Somehow I don't think I'll get very bored at work in the next several months. It's a nice feeling.
