Well, no baby yet. But that still doesn't mean my Monday has calmed down much. :-) We did a bunch of minivan shopping this weekend, and have found one that seems like it might be a good fit; in our price range, in decent shape, etc. I need to get my mechanic to look at it, and the first availability they have is tomorrow, so I guess I'll be patient until then. Actually, _my_ mechanic wasn't available until Wednesday, but a mechanic that a friend recommends highly is available tomorrow, so I'll go with that one. Maybe by then the bank will have gotten back to me on the loan approval.

If Becky goes into labor tonight or something, it'll throw a bit of a wrench in the car purchase works, but it'll be a welcome wrench. The van can wait. :-)
