It's Tuesday afternoon, and I'm sitting on the couch in a darkened hospital room. There's a little bit of hazy sunlight filtering through the miniblinds behind me, and a muted television sits ignored across the room. My wife is napping, my older daughter is at a friend's house, my newborn daughter is asleep in the bassinette, and I have had a few minutes of precious quiet. Sure, the nurse interrupted it a few minutes ago to check temperatures and pulses, but she is forgiven.

I have realized just a bit over the past couple of days how I thrive on being busy. I _am_ busy, you know. I am a project lead at work. I have a wife and two kids. I lead the worship teams at church and participate in leadership activities there. I've been playing basketball in two recreational leagues this winter. I maintain websites for [myself](http://thehubbs.net/chris/), [my family](http://thehubbs.net/), [my church](http://www.noelridge.org), and my friends' [ministry](http://www.recminusa.org) and [business](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com). I have a very hard time slowing down.

This came to me most vividly somewhere around noon yesterday. Addison had been born only nine hours before. Everything had been cleaned up, she was sleeping, Becky was resting, and I had eaten lunch. And I didn't know what to do next. I kept thinking that it was time to head to work, or think about work, or worship team, or _something_. Surely there's something I should be doing. And it took a while for me to realize that no, there was nothing else I needed to be doing. I should be right here, enjoying the rest, getting to know my new daughter, and caring for my wife.

Why do I feel the need to make it busier? Partly I'd like to ascribe it to my mental "wiring" - I don't handle boredom well. I like to multi-task. My wife marveled one night a couple of weeks ago when I was talking on my cell phone, having an IM conversation, and posting on my blog all at the same time. I hadn't even thought about it; it's just the way I operate. But I think more responsibility lies on the shoulders of my own choices and decisions. I need to make the conscious effort more often to slow down and enjoy the things in life right here around me. Busyness doesn't make life richer; rather, I think that busyness is the thief that steals the richness of the glory that we see in everyday life. It's time to think more about everyday life.

I think Addison is stirring now, so it's time to put this to practice and set down the laptop. The web sites can wait.
