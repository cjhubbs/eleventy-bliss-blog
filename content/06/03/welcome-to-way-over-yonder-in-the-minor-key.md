House of Cakeboy had about run its course, so after reflection the new blog title, as you can obviously see above, is "Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key". This wonderfully picturesque phrase is the title of a song from the album _Mermaid Avenue_, with lyrics by Woodie Guthrie and music by Billy Bragg & Wilco.

I don't know that I have much more to say about it at the moment; I created the new blog header and I'm fairly happy with it. Otherwise the layout hasn't changed much; I might switch it up when I get time to make it a little more customized.

So that's it for now, and it's late - I'm heading to bed.
