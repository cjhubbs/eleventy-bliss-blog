I hadn't realized how burned-out I was getting. When I step back and look at it now, it should've been obvious. I've been leading worship at Noelridge for the last 5 years or so, and have never taken off more than about 4 weeks a year. And those weeks were even more work than the weeks that I just led it myself. It wasn't the leading so much; it was the preparation. Planning the service, writing instrumental parts for our various musicians (some need chords! some need notes! some can transpose... some can't!), practicing beforehand, then leading. First it was one service per week, since last September it's two services. I was getting to the point where I didn't even want to do worship team.

It came to a head last fall. My initial position was that I wanted a bunch of time off. O.F.F. I didn't figure it was feasible, but it sure sounded nice. (It still does, sort of.) After some discussion with the pastor, we decided on a scheme that we started in January. Under this new scheme, I lead solo and usually take requests one Sunday a month, and another Sunday every month I enlist somebody else to plan and lead. God has blessed us with David, who is willing and able to plan, prepare music, and lead. He's been improving every month.

So this month, this upcoming Sunday is the week I'm off. Which means I don't have to worry about dealing with worship team practice tonight. I don't have to be there for the early service on Sunday if I don't want to. Heck, I don't have to be there _at all_ on Sunday if I don't want to. And it feels good. It's refreshing. And next week I'll be cranked up and ready to go again.

So that's my little thought for the day: rest is good. Time off is refreshing. Don't be afraid to ask for it. No sense in burning out.
