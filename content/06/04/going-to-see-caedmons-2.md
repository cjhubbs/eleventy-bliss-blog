Thanks to [Andrew Osenga's](http://www.andrewosenga.com) timely posting of more tour dates, I found that Caedmon's Call will be playing in Dubuque, IA - only an hour from my home! - this Saturday night. My wife has graciously agreed that she could do without me for the night, so I bought my ticket this morning (curses, Ticketmaster, on being the only game in town! one day there will be a reckoning for your extortionary fees!) and will be there tomorrow night. Should be fun. I'll try to post some pictures and a review this weekend.
