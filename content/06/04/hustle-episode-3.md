Hustle, Episode 3.

_Originally aired January 21, 2006_

I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot to say about this one. In this episode, Mickey pretends to run an art gallery. The con is to sell a forged painting, supposedly by Piet Mondrian, to a rich and snotty collector. There's the usual sneaky stuff, the usual headache with the forger, and Stacie as usual getting to distract the men (the guards, in this case) while the rest of the team pulls off the switcheroo.

On a random note, I wasn't familiar with Mondrian before this episode, but ran into a print of his somewhere the day after I watched the show. So now I know my Mondrian when I see it.
