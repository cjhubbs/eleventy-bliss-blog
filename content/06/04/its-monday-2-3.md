No, wait, it's Tuesday. It just feels like Monday. It was very very hard to get out of bed this morning. It was cool and there was rain pattering on the roof. But no, I had to get up and come to work. When I got to work, I found out that I'm losing a good engineer off of my project. Double-grrrrrr. And now I have meetings for pretty much the rest of the day: 10:00, 11:00, 1:00, 2:00, 2:30... the last three all overlap. Just another day.

On the bright side, you should go over to [Andy Osenga's website](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/04/24/after-the-garden/) and listen to the cut he's got up there from his upcoming album. It's amazing. He's finally taken the chance to really rock out on this one, and it sounds _great_. I have this album pre-ordered, which means I should be getting it in a couple of weeks... I can't wait. But hey, I have to. :-(
