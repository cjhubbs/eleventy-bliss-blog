It's opening day for major league baseball, and what a way to start: the Cubs scored 5 runs in the top of the first inning.

Welcome back, baseball, I'm ready to enjoy the season. :-)

**UPDATE:** And now they've let the Reds score 5, and Zambrano didn't even make it through 5 innings. :-( Welcome to life as a Cubs fan.
