Just for fun, a few pictures. First, from yesterday hunting easter eggs in Stone City:

Laura with the little lambs.

Last night, Laura and Addison on the chair, reading a book. OK, so I put Addison up there to create a photo-op. That's what parents do, right? :-)

And finally, Laura all dressed up to go to church this morning, in one of her Easter dresses. Becky bought this one, then Becky's mom bought the girls matching dresses. Then Debbie Berberich, yesterday, gave us matching dresses for the girls that might be a bit chilly yet for Easter, but it won't be long... Like they need more dresses. But hey, I'm the guy, and I'm a little bit outnumbered here. :-)
