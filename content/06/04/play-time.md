Yesterday, as the culmination of a lot of research by Becky, we went out and purchased a backyard play set for Laura. It was on sale at Toys'r'us. Woohoo for sales! We just barely got the box to fit in the van - we had to remove the back seat and then still bungee the back hatch down. But we got it home in one piece and then got it put up last night. It has a ladder on one side and a slide on the other. It took Laura about 2 tries to get the hand of the ladder, but then she did nothing but climb up and slide down in a circuit about 30 times in a row. I think she enjoys it. :-)
