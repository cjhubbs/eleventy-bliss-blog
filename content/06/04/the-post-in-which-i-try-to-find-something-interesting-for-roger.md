So my last few posts have been on [baseball](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/04/03/opening-day/) and [TV](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/04/04/hustle-episode-4/), and [Roger](http://www.qwertyuppy.com/)'s [not so excited about those.](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/04/03/opening-day/#comments) So this morning I'll try to find something that [Roger](http://www.qwertyuppy.com/) might enjoy.

First, some thoughts from my week. I'm having trouble adjusting to Daylight Savings Time. (They do DST in Maine, right [Roger](http://www.qwertyuppy.com/)?) It had been getting easier to get up in the mornings; now that it's dark again at 5:30, I'm struggling mightily to get out of bed on time. I suppose it's not hurting me any to get a few extra minutes of sleep, though.

The week has been relatively calm so far. Monday was church staff meeting, then we crashed at home in the evening. Yesterday we went out for supper at [Culver's](http://www.culvers.com/), then did a little shopping, and I went to the library. They had the Monk/Coltrane at Carnegie Hall CD available to borrow, so I snapped it up. I'll be giving it a listen this afternoon. Now it's Wednesday, with one short meeting coming up at 9:00, and then worship team practice tonight. Good times.

What else should I throw in here? [Roger](http://www.qwertyuppy.com/), you like poetry, right? Here's a link to the [website of one of my favorite poets](http://www.seussville.com/).

And to cap things off, here's a random Monty Python and the Holy Grail quote for you: "I don't want to get on the cart!"

We all know how that ended. :-)
