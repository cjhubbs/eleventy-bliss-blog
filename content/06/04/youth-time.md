OK, so my ankle is a little bit sore this morning.

I wonder if it has something to do with playing soccer barefoot in the church basement with the high school youth group last night?

Well, maybe. :-)

I haven't hung out with the youth for a while, but did last night at the youth pastor's invitation so we could plan the youth Sunday coming up on the 30th. And yeah, then I had to stick around and play soccer. Good times.
