I haven't been a fan of everything Orson Scott Card has ever written (sorry, [Keith](http://rmfo-blogs.com/theophileo/)), but [my love for _Ender's Game_](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2005/11/11/enders-game/) and [even greater affection for _Speaker for the Dead_](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/02/02/home-again-home-again/) drew me to read the next book in the series, _Xenocide_.

_Xenocide_ picks up Ender and company pretty much where _Speaker for the Dead_ left them. It introduces us to a few new characters along the way, but wrestles with the dilemma of being on a planet where saving the humans there will cause the death of the indigenous species. Card pulls off this drama in his usual thoughtful fashion, asking questions about the nature of life and consciousness.

I don't know that this one was quite as good as _Speaker_. I got a bit lost at the end once they start doing faster-than-light travel. It just got weird there for the last chapter or so. But still, if you've enjoyed _Ender_ and _Speaker_, I can definitely recommend that you continue on and read _Xenocide_.
