What a week.

Monday was wonderful.

Tuesday was lousy.

Wednesday was much, much better.

Now we get Thursday and Friday, and then the weekend and a week's visit from [the in-laws](http://thehubbs.net/bobandcarol/). And I like my in-laws. And on top of that, it means free babysitting for a couple nights so Becky and I can go out! :-)

Such is life from Iowa.
