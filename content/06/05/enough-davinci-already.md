I've heard just about enough about The DaVinci Code by now.

First, the hoopla over the best-selling novel.

Then, the adulation from the press and all of the discussion regarding the "historicity" of the fiction.

Next, the Christian reaction to the movie, covering the entire spectrum from "Cool" to "Yawn" to "EVIL, RUN FOR YOUR LIVES AND BURN THE HERETICS WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING!!!".

So it was with some hesitation that I read a piece on [Opinion Journal](http://www.opinionjournal.com) today entitled ["Debunking the Debunkers"](http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110008401). The topic: how would C.S. Lewis have responded to DaVinci Code fans? I was glad I read the article.

> "I have been reading poems, vision-literature, legends, myths all my life," Lewis wrote. "I know what they are like. I know that not one of them is like this \[the Bible\]."

So said Lewis, and he was right.

The wrap-up:

> Here is the real harm of these modern conspiracy theories: They may appeal to our emotions, but they violate our common sense. They reject reason, just as surely as they reject revelation. "I do not wish to reduce the skeptical element in your minds," Lewis explained. "I am only suggesting that it need not be reserved exclusively for the New Testament and the Creeds. Try doubting something else."

Good stuff.
