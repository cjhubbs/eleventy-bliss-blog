OK, let's see how many search engine hits _that_ title gets me. :-)

But seriously, folks, if you've read my blog for long, you've [heard me rave](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/04/28/andrew-osenga-the-morning/) about Andrew Osenga. You've even [seen some pictures](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/04/23/caedmons-call-dubuque-ia-42306/). If you've really explored my site you might have followed the link over on the right and visited [his blog](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/). But now you have the chance to get a free download of one of the songs off of his new album. This is an offer too good to pass up. Do it. Now.
