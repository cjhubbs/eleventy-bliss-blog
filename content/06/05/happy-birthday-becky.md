Only the best birthday wishes to my beautiful wife who turns 29 today. She is a faithful partner, dear friend, and loving mother to our girls. I am truly blessed.

Becky's parents are in town this week, so we'll all go out for dinner to our new favorite BBQ place tonight to celebrate. And, woohoo for me, I knew what I wanted to get her for a gift, bought it on time, and got it wrapped up. Well, sort of wrapped up. It's at least in a box... Maybe I'm getting this husbandly-gift-giving stuff down finally... :-)
