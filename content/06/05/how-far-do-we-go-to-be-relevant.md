[That's the question that the InternetMonk asks](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/how-much-is-too-much) in a column over the weekend. His summary:

> The Gospel is relevant. Our methods canâ€™t be irrelevant, but they have to allow the relevance of Christ to come to the forefront.

Amen, brother.
