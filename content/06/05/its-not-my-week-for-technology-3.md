On the heels of my stereo receiver biting the dust, tonight I pulled my Palm Tungsten E2 out of my pocket to schedule a lunch meeting, and it came up dead. The backlight stayed on, the screen was blank, and it wouldn't respond to a reset, even a hard reset. I've only had it for 9 months. Of course, the Palm warranty is only 90 days... what a rip-off.

I don't know what I want to do about a PDA now. I might try going without it for a couple weeks and see how much I miss it... but I know it'll be bad. If I hadn't just spent $200 on a stereo, buying a new PDA wouldn't seem totally out of the question, but now... grrr... and I'm not very motivated to want to buy another Palm brand PDA. I'll have to see what kind of employee discount I can get on a Dell handheld, maybe.
