Monday night was our second church softball game of the year, and it was beautiful. We were afraid the rain was going to keep us from playing, but it held off until just after we finished. The night was perfect, we had enough players, and we played solid the whole game. We got hits when we needed them, even our weakest players drew some walks, came around and scored, and I managed a couple good defensive plays at third base. This reminds me why I enjoy softball so much - the fun with friends, a good competitive game.... what a blessing, and good times.
