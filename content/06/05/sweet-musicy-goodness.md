I've hit the new CD jackpot over the past few days; last weekend found [Jill Phillips](http://www.jillphillips.com)' new _Nobody's Got It All Together_ in my mailbox. Yesterday then brought [Andy Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com)'s new _The Morning_ and remastered _Photographs_. I've listened through each of them about once so far. Good stuff. I'm sure I'll post more, at least on Osenga, later.

I just realized that I haven't posted anything yet about the Square Peg Alliance. The Alliance is a group of artists that have banded together, feeling that they are the square pegs that don't quite fit in the round holes that music is expected to be these days. The aforementioned Andy Osenga and Jill Phillips are members, as well as other artists I write about here from time to time, like [Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com), [Andrew Peterson](http://www.andrew-peterson.com), [Andy Gullahorn](http://www.andygullahorn.com), [Derek Webb](http://www.derekwebb.com), and [Sandra McCracken](http://www.sandramccracken.com). Their website isn't much yet, but the [fan website over at squarepegalliance.net](http://www.squarepegalliance.net) is up and kicking. I am actually [on staff](http://squarepegalliance.net/about/about-chris-hubbs/) for the website, but I'm afraid I haven't done a whole lot with it yet...
