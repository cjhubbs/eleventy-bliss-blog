[Dick Staub](http://www.dickstaub.com) on the Staublog (which needs to move to some software that supports RSS in an awful way) [today notes a phrase](http://dickstaub.com/culturewatch.php?record_id=1007) that caught my ear:

> People like that I sign my correspondence "yours for the pursuit of God in the company of friends." When I was younger I thought a lot about "doing" things for the kingdom of God. Now I think more about loving people in my day.

I like that phrase. "The pursuit of God in the company of friends." Sounds like what I want to be doing.
