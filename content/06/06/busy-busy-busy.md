So it's been several days and still I haven't managed to find the time to write-up the Andy O concert from last Tuesday. Tsk tsk. It has been a busy week. I'm getting packed up tonight to head to Atlanta for a work-related conference. Maybe I'll have some time in the evenings for updating.

One quick bit of good news - heard from [Aaron](http://thehubbs.net/aaron/) tonight and [he's coming home from Panama on Wednesday!](http://thehubbs.net/aaron/2006/06/25/coming-home/) Woohoo!
