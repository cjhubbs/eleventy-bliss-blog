So between Tuesday and Wednesday I put about 1300 miles on the car over a span of 20 hours on the road. The car ran great, I had some good stuff to listen to on the drive down (D.A. Carson on Postmodernism and the use of the O.T. by the N.T.), and it went really well. The concert was great. It'll merit at least one post, maybe a couple of 'em, when I get the time. Well worth the drive - I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Next time, though, I'll take Becky along. :-)
