Having been disgusted with my lack of exercise for a while, and having been challenged by my wife's initiative to start swimming on a regular basis, I bit the bullet yesterday and set my alarm back an extra half-hour so I could get up and run to start the morning. Yesterday morning wasn't too bad - I was ready to get up at 5:15, I did about 2 miles in 20 minutes, and felt pretty good. Woohoo!

Fast-forward to this morning. 5:15 seemed much earlier. I was sore. But I argued enough with myself to go ahead and get out of bed and do it again. But my heel was hurting this time; it felt like it was rubbing funny against my shoe, enough to hurt a bit, but I didn't think there was much to it. Finally I sat down on a park bench about half-way through my run, and found that I had a bloody sock to rival Curt Schilling's. Bummer. I guess it was worse than I thought. So I'm wearing my sandals to work today, and I'll have to figure out what to do with the shoes this weekend. I've had 'em for 3 years or so, but haven't worn them that much - they should still be in decent shape... oh well, I'll figure it out this weekend.

So anyway, now I'm at work feeling a little bit sore. But that feels good - much better to have sore muscles than to be feeling fat and lazy. :-)
