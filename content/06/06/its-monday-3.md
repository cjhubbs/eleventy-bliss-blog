That's actually not a bad thing, just a statement of fact. Had a nice weekend; installed a screen door on the side entrance to our house. It went pretty easily, but I ran down the batteries in my drill and had to wait until Sunday for them to charge up so I could finish the job. _Note to self: pick up a cheap electric (plug-in) drill sometime so that doesn't happen again._

Sunday was nice, church in the morning went well, then finished the aforementioned screen door, then later on we took Laura to the splashpad at the park. She's still a little bit scared of the water, and quite a bit intimidated by the throngs of (larger) kids, but she's figuring it out and getting braver. I have to keep reminding myself that she's not even 2 yet. Amazing. Then we came home and I washed all of the nasty tree pollen and junk off the car, Laura helped with that, too. Give her a wash rag and she has all sorts of fun. Becky took some pictures, if they turned out I'll have to post one.

It was awesome sleeping weather last night; it only got down to about 70 in the house, but the humidity was really low. Nice to have the windows open again and the a/c off at least for a day. Now it's Monday and back-to-work time. This afternoon is softball... it will be fun to play again after a week off for the holiday. I've got [Andy O](http://www.andrewosenga.com)'s _The Morning_ playing on the iPod for about the zillionth time since I got it, and it's still good. Probably even better than the first several times. More good stuff to appreciate each time. You'll probably get tired of my raving about _The Morning_ before I get tired of raving, so just get used to it... or go buy the album and joing the raving maniacs. :-)
