After hearing the announcement that "much rock will be had", I decided if I could make it work in my schedule, I'd head on a road trip to Nashville to see [Andrew Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com)'s _The Morning_ CD release concert. The schedule worked out, and next thing you know, I was on the road.

It's not as bad a drive as I'd feared from Cedar Rapids to Nashville. I left at 4:30 am, and with very minimal stoppage I arrived in Nashville by 2:30 pm. I checked into my motel and then left to drive around and aquaint myself with the Nashville area. I drove past one shopping mall that was very dead, and then another one which turned out to be the Green Hills Mall that [Andy Gullahorn](http://www.andygullahorn.com) sings about. After having located Mercy Lounge and how to get there, I went back to my motel to crash.

I apparently gave myself too much time to get down to the Lounge, because I got there about 30 minutes before the published "doors open" time. Deciding to escape the heat and humidity outside, I stuck my head in and managed to hear the end of Andy and the band's sound check.

There were two openers for Andy; the first was Dave somebody; he sported a Napoleon Dynamite-style afro and a bunch of falsetto vocals with his acoustic guitar. Not bad, but not very memorable. The second act was Matthew Perryman Jones. MPJ is one of the [Square Pegs](http://www.squarepegalliance.com), but I hadn't heard any of his music until that night. He was very good. He played a few songs solo, then brought Andy O, Cason Cooley, and Eric Weigel up to play with him. Again, very good stuff. I bought his new CD _Throwing Punches In The Dark_ after the show.

Then it was time for Andy. He was playing with a full band: Cason Cooley on keyboards, Eric Chris Weigel on bass, Paul Eckberg on drums, and a guitarist Jason Feller on guitar, and a percussionist whose name escaped me. They played a lot of music from Andy's new album _The Morning_, starting out in album order with _In Gym Class In High School_, _After The Garden_, and _White Dove_. He played a few songs from his earlier album _Photographs_, including _Kara_ and _When Will I Run_. The highlight of the night was probably his rocking _Santa Barbara_ from the new album. It is a classic roll-the-windows-down rock and roll song, and it was great that night.

I thoroughly enjoyed the show, and also the chance to meet a bunch of folks, some I had already met, some I had not. This is where I name drop (though is it really name dropping if the people are only "names" to a few people?) : [Geof Morris](http://www.gfmorris.net) (of [rmfo.net](http://rocksmyfaceoff.net) fame), Ron Davis (aka Ronzilla) of [moreron.com](http://www.moreron.com), a couple of other dot.netters, and then in addition to the aforementioned band members, there were [Jeremy Casella](http://www.jeremycasella.com), [Chris Mason](http://www.chrismason.com), [Andy Peterson](http://www.andrew-peterson.com), Ben Shive, [Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com), and oh yeah, Andy O's wife Alison. Very cool.

After helping carry Andy's gear down to his car, I called it a night and crashed hard at the motel. The following day brought me back on the reverse trip from Nashville to Cedar Rapids; again about a 10 hour drive. It was a great time, well worth the drive. As I told Andy, next time I'll come back, but I'll bring my wife along. :-)
