In a bout of insanity, I have decided to take two days off work and drive to Nashville for [Andy Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com)'s [CD release concert](http://upcoming.org/event/83834/). I don't know what possessed me. But I'm looking forward to getting to meet [Geof](http://gfmorris.net) and maybe some others, and seeing Andy do a full show with a full band... awesome.
