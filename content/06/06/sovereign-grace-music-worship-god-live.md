Several weeks ago Bob Kauflin, on his Worship Matters blog, [offered a free copy](http://www.worshipmatters.com/bobkauflin/2006/05/worship_god_liv.html) of the new Sovereign Grace worship CD, _[Worship God Live](http://www.sovereigngraceministries.org/music/projects/worshiplive/)_ to the first 50 worship leaders who would agree to review it on their own blogs. I was one of the first 50, and my blog review is long overdue.

_Worship God Live_ is a collection of 14 new songs, performed by the Sovereign Grace worship band as led by Bob Kauflin and Pat Sczebel. It sounds pretty much like you'd expect a live worship album to sound; the musicians are good, there are the typical lead singers with a larger background vocal group, the style is very similar to what you'd hear from a Passion worship album. Which is to say, good stuff.

As you listen to the lyrics of these songs, you are immediately struck by the depth and richness of the content. These are not the simple, schmaltzy, repetitive, cliche lyrics that haunt the thoughtful worship leader. These songs were obviously written by people who have thought through and understood the matchless grace and wonder of God, and who want to express it in the congregational music setting. As a worship leader, I am encouraged to hear new material with rich content. It is sorely needed in today's churches.

My chief difficulty with the album comes from the musical part of the songs. My experience in worship music has been that people who lead large worship bands with professional musicians tend to write music best performed by those large, professional bands. Fine and good, if you attend a church of that size and caliber. But for the worship leader in the smaller church, with volunteer musicians of varying ability, they just don't fit the bill. Recent worship music that _has_ worked well for us has been simpler; _How Deep The Father's Love For Us_ and _In Christ Alone_ are two good examples. I found myself wishing that this album's songwriters had taken the little guys into account on at least some of the songs.

All that being said, there is one song on the album that stands out in its quality, singability, and message, and which I will be taking at some point soon to my worship team: _Jesus, Thank You_. It presents the gospel message so beautifully, and could be used by congregations of any size as beautiful praise to the Savior.
