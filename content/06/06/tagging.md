I have decided to start tagging rather than categorizing my posts; The tagging paradigm (implemented nicely in this case by [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/)) makes so much sense I won't even start on it.

I have tagged my last 15 or so posts, I'm not about to go back and tag all three-hundred-plus of them. So I'll leave the categories over on the sidebar for a while along with the tags.

It came to my attention the other day that the sidebar is all screwed up in Internet Explorer; it displays way down at the bottom of the page on the left. I may be able to fix this at some point, but for now, if you're using IE, do yourself a favor and go get [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com). You can thank me later. :-)
