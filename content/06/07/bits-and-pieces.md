I wait far too long between blog posts, and then I find myself searching for interesting things to write about. I guess my life, if not boring, is at a minimum mundane.

I'm adjusting to actually being in the office all week this week; it's been about a month since I did an actual five-day in-office stretch. It's not too bad.

Took Andrew and Rebecca out for dinner last night, then they watched the girls while Becky and I went to see the new Pirates of the Carribean movie. My take on the movie: parts of it were quite fun, comic even, and it certainly hearkened back to swashbuckling movies of old. My main grip with it was that it didn't really resolve much; it was too directly setting you up for Pirates 3, which will come out next year. It felt much more like the end-of-season cliffhanger on a TV series than the satisfactory conclusion of a movie. But still... Johnny Depp is hilariously over the top.

I picked up a Virgin Wireless cell phone yesterday to be my travel phone. Roaming is horribly expensive on our current US Cellular plan, and we don't really need it often. However, now that I'm traveling more for business, it'd be nice to be in touch for less than $0.69/minute. So I now have a pay-as-you-go phone that I'll use for my travels. It has a Cedar Rapids number, which I'll be happy to give you if you're wanting to keep in touch with me while I'm on travel.

What else?. The folks and Aaron are coming down this weekend to celebrate Laura's birthday. Andrew interviewed for a job here in Cedar Rapids yesterday; it sounds like he'll be living here and taking some classes as Kirkwood this fall. I heard rumor that Aaron may be looking at moving to Florida... but haven't heard anything specific yet.

So that's the (mundane) news from Iowa today. When I think of something more interesting, I'll be sure to post it.
