Yesterday was Laura's second birthday. So, we invited a bunch of friends over to celebrate. Actually, this was her second birthday party this year; we had one with my family on Saturday, and now one with friends. Two years old, two parties. Don't get any ideas about next year, kiddo!

So the Scotts, the Finleys, the Wilburs, the Garner women (freshly-minted First Officer Daniel was supposed to get home last night sometime after being gone for six weeks!) and my brother and sister came over. It was waaay to warm and humid in the backyard, but we sweltered through it and munched on hot dogs, salads, fruit, and the requsite cake and ice cream. Laura opened a few presents and then there were gift bags for all the kiddos that were a big hit. I think it's safe to say that a good time was had by all.

We took a bunch of pictures, but I didn't get them off the camera last night. I'll try to remember to add them to this post when I get a chance. I still can't believe she's two already...
