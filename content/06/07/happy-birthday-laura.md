She's too young to read this, but still, I can't believe that my little girl turns 2 today! It seems like just yesterday we were bringing her home from the hospital, and now she's a little fireball, talking a blue streak, playing with her little sister, and enjoying her new fishies. Scary to think that it only speeds up from here...
