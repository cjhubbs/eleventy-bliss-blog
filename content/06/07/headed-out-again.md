Once more work will have me leaving Cedar Rapids for a few days. I leave at 6:50 tomorrow morning from CID to travel to Seattle for 3 days. I will get to add Washington to the list of states I've visited, but there won't be time for sightseeing - 3 days of meetings will have me ready to come home on Thursday night late.
