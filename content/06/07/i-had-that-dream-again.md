Yeah, that dream. The one where Andy Osenga and some other unidentified people are holed up with me in a house (not my house, dunno what house it is) when bad guys show up with guns. We call 911, but the cops are in on it, so no help there. We are tricky, though, and manage to escape out the back way. We run behind a little hill and hide and we're laying in the water in this lake, peering over the hill, watching the bad guys search through the house.

Maybe the bad guys were looking for the automatic weapons that we had found hidden in the attic of the house; they were up there in the rafters next to the 100 baud modem. I don't know the answer to that one.

What does it all mean? I report, you decide.
