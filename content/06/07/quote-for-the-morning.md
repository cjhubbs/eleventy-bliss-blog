_Every generation has cooler music than the generation that came before it. Unless you're two generations before and then it's "hey, that's kinda cool, let's use that..."_

\-- Josh Harris, talking about church music while preaching on [Humble Orthodoxy](http://newattitude.org/beta/humbleorthodoxy/)
