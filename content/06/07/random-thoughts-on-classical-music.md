For those of you brave enough to read past the title, congratulations! Now instead of me talking about music by people my age, you get to hear me talk about music written by dead people. Well, they weren't dead when they wrote it... but let's not confuse the issue.

I grew up listening to lots of classical music. This was pretty much due to the fact that my parents listened to lots of classical music, and I was too young to buy records or run the record player. So classical it was. I remember Bach Cello suites, including a neat recording played by John Williams or Segovia or somebody on the guitar. Dad liked Stravinsky, so we heard some of that, too. And then there was the requisite Beethoven, and then some fun stuff by Prokofiev. (Though the title "_Love for Three Oranges_" sounds kinda kinky now that I think about it...)

Then I started taking piano lessons, and gained some more personal appreciation for composers. I think I initially got started playing Grieg because my friend Lydia was playing him, and I wanted to out-do her. However, he quickly became a favorite. Then I got my skill up to where I could tackle Chopin's _Ballades_. They're still some of my favorites. (How do I pick between No. 1 in G-Minor and No. 4 in F minor? Too tough to call!) And then there was Rachmaninoff. I hacked through his _Second Piano Concerto_ during my first couple of years of high school. It was only after college that I picked up some of his _Preludes_, _Etudes Tableux_, and his wonderful arrangement of Kreisler's _Liebesfreud_.

Oh, and any talk about my classical music history wouldn't be complete without mentioning that tape of Tchaikovsky's _1812 Overture_ and _Capriccio Italien_ that got played over and over and over and over in the van.

I don't have classical music on that much any more; I'm going to have to make sure that I turn it on more often so Laura and Addison grow up with at least an exposure to it. Laura, though, already watches a Classical Baby DVD that has a bunch of good stuff on it; Mozart, Bach, Schumann, Bartok, and Villa Lobos, to name just a few. I guess that's a good start. Next I'll pull out some Mussorgsky...
