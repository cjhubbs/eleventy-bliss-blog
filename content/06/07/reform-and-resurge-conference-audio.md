I just finished listening to a message that [Matt Chandler](http://www.theresurgence.com/profile_matt_chandler) gave at the [Reform and Resurge conference](http://www.theresurgence.com/reform_resurge_conference_2006) (held at Mars Hill Church earlier this summer) on the topic "The Weight of Pastoring and the Knowledge of Christ". It is phenomenal. If you're involved in ministry at all, this particular message is worth a listen. You can download the mp3 here:

I'm downloading the rest of the sessions from the conference so I have something to listen to on next week's business trip. If anybody (Richard, this means you!) wants a copy on CD to listen to in the car or something, I'll burn you one, just let me know.
