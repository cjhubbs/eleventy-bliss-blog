This weekend I signed up for a 5K run. I've never done something like this before. I've not been a big runner in past years, but with 30 approaching and too many pounds around my waistline, it is time to get more serious about it. I have increased motivation to run; finding time is still the difficulty.

Inspired in a good part by [Jeff](http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/) and [Adriene](http://thedirtroad.net/adriene/)'s efforts, I sent in my registration Saturday to run in a 5K in Solon on September 16th. In a fit of insanity, my sister [Rebecca](http://thehubbs.net/rebecca/) agreed to run it with me. She'll probably beat me, too. So now I have seven weeks to try to get ready for it.

I'm not really scared of the distance; when I get out and run now I do 2.5 - 3 miles in about 30 minutes. I still end up having to interspurse some walking amidst the jogging. I just need to push my endurance up so I can walk less and jog more.

An aside here: I found a really cool website that has been helpful: [mapmyrun.com](http://www.mapmyrun.com). It uses the Google Maps API to allow you to chart a run (even going cross-country if you want to!). It'll then show you the mileage of that run, and, given the time it took you to run it and your age, height, and weight, will even calculate a calorie burn. Maps can be saved and shared. Pretty cool. You can see [my little 5K training map](http://www.mapmyrun.com/view_run.php?r=ad60e0d0f03c58baccf2759d918cbbbf) if you want to.

It'll be tough to train any this week, seeing as I have a full day today and then I'm headed to Seattle tomorrow morning early. Maybe once I get back and it's a bit cooler I can start cranking out the miles. I've gotta try...
