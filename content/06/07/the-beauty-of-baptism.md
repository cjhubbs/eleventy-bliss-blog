We had a baptismal "service", if you can call it that, last night at Pleasant Creek Park in Palo. I love the fact that we have our baptisms on a public beach which is otherwise populated by lots of families with children noisily splashing and swimming. Three were baptized last night; a young girl from a family recently attending our church, and then a father and son. It is an amazing and beautiful thing to hear a 45-year-old man stand up and say that God has worked in his life and he and his son are being baptized to publicly say that "we're followers of Jesus Christ."

Praise God and Amen!
