I bought a new pair of Asics running shoes over the weekend and wow, what a difference they make! Beside the fact that they don't tear up my heel like the old ones did, they also have a much greater amount of padding and bounce when I run. What a nice change! Here's to hoping I stay disciplined with the running so that I wear this pair out sooner than the last pair. :-)
