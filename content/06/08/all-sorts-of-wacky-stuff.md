Or at least what counts for wacky in my world. I realize my life is pretty calm compared to some of the rest of you.

- I ran 2 miles this morning. And actually ran the whole thing, didn't walk _at all_. My time was 19:14, which isn't awesome, but is tolerable. I'll shoot for the 5k distance again tomorrow.
- I witnessed something last night at our church softball game (the last one of the season :-() which I had never witnessed before: the two umpires getting into a shouting match with each other. In our league, each team volunteers a player to ump the game before (or after) their own game. It's usually very low-key. But the field ump made a call last night and the plate ump over-ruled him, and they got into it. Then towards the end of the game the plate ump ended the game and walked off the field, when the rule clearly states that we could've started the 7th inning. Grrrr... but it was a good game, we played well and won.
- Evening shows like [this one](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/08/21/its-hip-to-be-square/) make me wish I lived close to Nashville. The closest any of the [Square Pegs](http://squarepegalliance.com) will be getting to Iowa this year is when [Andy P](http://www.andrew-peterson.com) plays in Omaha and Lincoln, NE. Not close enough.

Well, I guess most of that wasn't wacky. But it was stuff, though, you can't deny it was stuff. One outta two isn't bad.
