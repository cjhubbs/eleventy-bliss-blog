This song has been rattling around in my head for the past day or two. It's beautiful, intense, personal stuff, made all the moreso by the knowledge that Andy was really writing this about himself.

My struggles haven't been specifically with anger like is dealt with here, but I still understand the feeling of "waiting for the ice to break" - for that cold stasis of the soul to crack up into rushing, vibrant spring - Rich Mullins' streams "all swollen with winter, winter unfrozen, free to run away now..." What a beautiful call to repentance, renewal, and refreshing.

> You're floating like some Lost episode  
> Now you're there and I want you but how  
> How can I get there inside your house of mirrors  
> Are you looking for a window,  
> Are you looking for a door?  
> <br/>
> Cause it's been too long, too long - It's been like this too long.  
> <br/>
> There's Scripture taped up to the wall now  
> Are you getting any solace  
> From the promises, the Word?  
> Cause you're angry,  
> And you can call it what you want to,  
> But the tree grows from the seeds in your ground  
> <br/>
> And it's been too long, too long - It's been like this too long  
> <br/>
> Cause you're lonely  
> And when Matthew said forgiveness  
> Your heart leapt and your eyes looked away  
> You get so busy with the hours and the mortgage  
> You can turn cold and ignore how you've changed  
> <br/>
> Cause we're all praying for the ice to break  
> Waiting for our friend to come back to us again  
> <br/>
> Cause you're hurting more than anybody  
> And they've got no power over you now...  
> <br/>
