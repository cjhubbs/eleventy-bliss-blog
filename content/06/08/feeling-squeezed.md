Yesterday I was sitting at my desk working away when suddenly, bzzt! and one of my monitors went dark. I have been using two monitors for the past couple of years; I have two CRTs on my desk; one 21" behemoth and one 19" behemoth's-younger-brother. My desk panel that they sit on is bowed down in the middle by about an inch because of the weight. I've been wishing for LCD monitors for a while (hey, the new folks have them!) but the company's policy is that we'll only replace them when they die.

So yesterday my 21" HP monitor died. It had been showing symptons for a month or so now, so I'm not too suprised. I have a new 19" LCD monitor on order; hopefully it'll get delivered yet this afternoon; if not, definitely tomorrow. Then I can go back to working in wide-screen happiness. As it is right now, I'm limited to 1600 x 1200 resolution, and I'm feeling a bit squeezed.
