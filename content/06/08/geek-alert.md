The title is just a warning that some of your eyes might glaze over whilst reading this post. Others of you will find it interesting. Still others of you might have good advice to offer me...

Anyhow, I needed a good geek project to work on this weekend, I wanted to try something new. So I have this old PC sitting downstairs that I'm not using for anything except as a backup for the laptop and for doing filesharing (gotta love [indieriver.net](http://www.indieriver.net)!), and it's bogged down with lots of stuff; I've had it for 5 or 6 years now and never wiped it or reloaded it. So, I decided to have some fun and try doing a Linux installation. I actually settled on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), which appears to have a fairly decent desktop interface and a nicely-designed installation.

Installing Ubuntu was actually very easy. I backed up the little data I wanted to save onto the laptop, then went ahead and repartitioned the 60 GB hard drive. The installation went quickly, and I was up and running. Getting a driver to work for my D-Link DWL-G122 USB Wifi adapter was a bit more of a challenge. But I got it working Saturday night after some serious consultation of the Ubuntu help forums.

Basically I'm stuck with two things right now. 1) I have a printer attached to the Linux machine, and it works fine. However, I need to get it shared with the laptop. I almost had it last night, but no such luck. There's some combination of Samba and CUPS settings that I haven't hit on yet that should do the trick. 2) I need to get a file sharing program running. The obvious choice is Azureus. However, it's running into Java errors and hanging up on me; I end up having to **kill -9** it every time. I did a brief web search for other torrent programs that might be good, but haven't found anything I'm very happy with yet. I used [Utorrent](http://www.utorrent.com) when I was using Windows, and like it a lot. Unfortunately, there's no Linux version available.

Any suggestions from anybody for a torrent program? Should I just try debugging the Java issues in Azureus? Since that's the primary function of that PC, it'd be nice to have it working. And I can't afford to spend too many more nights up past 10 pm working on it. It makes it really hard to get up in the morning and run.
