Well, it's off to Seattle, actually, in about 30 minutes. Headed up there again for work, catching the little yucky turboprop from CID to MSP and then a 757 to SEA... Hopefully there won't be as much excitement as [last time](/06/07/traveling-adventures/)...

I've got a new book to read on the way that I'm quite looking forward to: N.T. Wright's _Simply Christian_. Hopefully I can digest it and give a little report when I get back.
