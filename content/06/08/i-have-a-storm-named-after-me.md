I just noticed that the most recent tropical storm of the season is named [Chris](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT3+shtml/011149.shtml?). Oh goody! They finally named one after me.

Let's just hope it doesn't do as much damage as that one they named after my brother [Andrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_andrew).
