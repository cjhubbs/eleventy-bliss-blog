Got home from Seattle about midnight last night. Oh so much fun. Our plane was late leaving Seattle, but fortunately we had a good tail wind or we never would've made the connection in Minneapolis. As it was, could our gates have been further apart? Not really. We landed at F8 and had to get to A6. I think we were the last two on the plane. But we got home. Oh, and I got to fly first class from Seattle to MSP. That was nice.

I'm hitting work for long enough to catch up a bit and file my expense report, then I'm going home to see Becky and the girls. On a totally unrelated note, if I have time to crash this weekend, I'm thinking of converting my old PC down in the basement to run some \*nix flavor instead of Windows... Ubuntu is looking like the early favorite. Should be a fun task.
