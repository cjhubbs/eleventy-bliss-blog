After being a slacker yesterday morning, I got up and did my 5k distance again this morning.

Times:

Mile 1: 8:18 Mile 2: 9:55 (total 18:14) Mile 3: 10:46 (total: 29:00) End: 31:29

This was about 20 seconds slower than my Monday run. In fact, that's the exact same time for my first mile, and only 8 seconds slower for my second mile. I guess I'm at least consistent. Now one of these days I can focus on kicking up the pace a little.

The Solon 5K is only 24 days away...
