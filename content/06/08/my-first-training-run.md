I have a 5K course mapped out through our neighborhood, so I gave it my first try at that distance on Friday. It was early afternoon, probably 85 degrees out. Here were my split times:

Mile 1: 7:43  
Mile 2: 18:56  
Mile 3: 31:38  
End: 34:20

I was cranking it out the first mile, didn't have to walk much at all. Actually, through the whole thing, it wasn't the cardio part that was slowing me down - it was my legs. My calves were cramping up pretty bad. The second mile I walked more; obviously, I went from an 8-minute mile to an 11-minute second mile. The third mile was then about 12 minutes. There is a nice long uphill grade to finish the third mile, it's a good test.

All in all, 34 minutes isn't too awful for my first try. I need to keep at this, though, so I can be better prepared for the 5K on September 16th.
