**Odd**: 13, the number of runs we had last night in our softball game. Also the number of runs our opponents had. After 7 innings it was just too dark to continue to play (8:30 pm or so), so we called it a draw. It was a beautiful night, and a fun game.

**End**: The end of the run yesterday was about 2 miles from where I started it. Enough, at least, to get my blood pumping. I did the first mile without walking at all. Woohoo!

**Odd**: 15, the day of the month today. Which means that it's my brother Ryan's birthday today!

**End**: This is the end of the post.
