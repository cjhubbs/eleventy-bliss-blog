This coming Sunday night my brothers [Aaron](http://thehubbs.net/aaron/) and Andrew and I will be doing a concert for my church. Noelridge has annually had a church potluck in the park on Labor Day Sunday; for the past several years we've had the Faris family (talented bluegrass types from Kansas), but now they've moved up in the world and we can't afford them any more. (Good for them!) So as their amateur replacements, the Hubbs brothers will be providing the musical entertainment this year.

I'm looking forward to this immensely. I have [blogged](/05/05/making-music-family-style/) [before](/05/05/music-family-style-for-real/) about the fun of playing music with my family, and this is no different. The music will be stuff that we've goofed around with before but never really performed; stuff by Caedmon's Call, Derek Webb, Andrew Peterson, Andy Osenga, and others.

I only have a couple of more tasks in preparation: I need to try to drum up an electric piano we can use for the night (I know who to call, I just have to make the call) and I need to practice. I need to practice a lot.

_What: Noelridge Park Church potluck and concert in the park Where: Noelridge Park Pavilion When: Sunday, September 3rd, 5:30 PM Bring: a dish to share and a lawnchair._
