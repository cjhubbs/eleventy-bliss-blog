I'm going to make a real effort to do a bunch of running this week. I've been too much of a slacker; I need to crank it up. I ran 5K this morning, it was nice and dark and cool. I made it \*almost\* 2 miles before I had to walk... I was rather disgusted with myself then that I did walk for 30 seconds or so.

Mile 1: 8:18  
Mile 2: 9:47 (total: 18:05)  
Mile 3: 10:43 (total 28:48)  
End: 31:10

The Solon 5K is less than three weeks away...
