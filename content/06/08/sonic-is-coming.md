Back in Texas, Sonic was a favorite fast food place of ours. Who can top the Route 44 Cherry Limeade? When we moved to Iowa, we had to kick the habit; there's only one Sonic in Iowa, and it's two hours away in Des Moines.

But then we found out a couple of months ago that there are plans to build several Sonics in our area.

Then even better, we found out this morning that they're building the first one, to open around December 1, _only four blocks from our house._

I sense some cherry limeades in my future. :-)
