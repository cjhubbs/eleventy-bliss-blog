A trusty IT guy came by this morning to deliver a new Dell 19" LCD monitor. He was also good enough to haul away the old 21" CRT behemoth. Amazing how my 19" CRT now looks fuzzy and crappy in comparison.

The one downside is that the resolution of the LCD is only 1280 x 1024, and I'm more used to running 1600 x 1200. But I'll adjust some font sizes and then get used to it. Well worth it to have the new monitor. And I can see some of my desk again!
