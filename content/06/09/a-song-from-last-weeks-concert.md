Here's a song that recorded pretty well from last week's concert. I'm playing guitar and Andrew is singing. Oh yeah, the song is _Heaven Is Waiting_, from the _Canticle of the Plains_ CD.

Fair warning: the audio is a bit fuzzy in places; the recording equipment I used was crude (RCA outs from the sound board at church directly into a mic input on a PC), and we maxed it out more than once. This is probably the least-fuzzy song of the night. :-(
