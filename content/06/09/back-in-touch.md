Sorry for the lack of updates over the past few days. I was in a "Foundations of Leadership" class for work. It was off-site, all day every day for three days. A pretty good class, but man, do I feel out of touch.

But now it's Friday! The folks and Aaron will be headed down here tonight, we'll work on some music practice, and Sunday night is our little concert in the park... pray that the rain holds off!
