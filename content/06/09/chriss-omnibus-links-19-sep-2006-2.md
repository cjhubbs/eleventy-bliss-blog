While I dont' generate quite as much link traffic as, say, [Geof](http://ijsm.org/archives/2006/09/19/links-for-2006-09-19/) does, I figure it might still be fun from time to time to give you some idea of the web links I've been following and reading. Then you, my intelligent, discerning, and thoughtful readers, can enjoy this Chris-approved list of goodness. :-)

**Spiritual/Theological/Church Links**

    _A reminder that the communion service should be a time of rejoicing in our salvation rather than a morose reflection on our own sin._

    _This is the best post I've read on worship in a long, long time. The thoughts in here will reshape the way we think about and do worship at Noelridge._

**Geeky Links**

- [Download of the Day: myFairTunes6 \[Lifehacker\]](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/drm/download-of-the-day-myfairtunes6-windows-198522.php)  
    _This nifty little app will strip the DRM information from iTunes downloads._

    _I'm still torn on Google Desktop; it's a great tool, but I'm just a little bit leery of a Google app searching through all the documents on my computer. Still, these are some great tweaks and ideas._
