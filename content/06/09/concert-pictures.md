[![Chris](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/music002.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/music002.jpg "Chris")I am long overdue to post pictures from the concert that my brothers and I played a few weeks ago at church. Thanks to my sister [Rebecca](http://thehubbs.net/rebecca/) for taking them! Oh, I did [post a song last week](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/09/10/a-song-from-last-weeks-concert/), but I never did really discuss the concert. So, let me discuss it.

[![The Brothers](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/music014.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/music014.jpg "The Brothers")We had planned to do the concert outdoors at Noelridge Park; our church has an annual Labor Day Sunday picnic and we were the entertainment. That Sunday was quite rainy in Cedar Rapids. The rain had pretty much stopped by 4:30 when we went to set up, so we set up in the park while keeping an eye on the ominous clouds still to the west. At 5:00 it was looking really dark, and a call to Becky at home confirmed that there was more rain a-comin'. So I decided to pack it up and we moved over to our rain location at the church. Wouldn't you know it, by 6:00 pm the sky had cleared, and we had the most beautiful cool evening... grrrr. Oh well, you win some, you lose some. Still, it was a fun concert.

I played bass and keyboard, Andrew played bass and guitar, and Aaron was a full-time awesome guitarist. The set went well, though I may have gone overboard by singing AP's _Alien Conspiracy (The Cheese Song)_. We finished the night with AO's _Early in the Morning_, which was an awesome closer.

Thanks to God for musical talent, loving family, and talented songwriters to steal from draw from!
