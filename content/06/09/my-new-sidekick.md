Over the weekend I picked up a little [Moleskine pocket notebook](http://www.moleskineus.com/ruledpocket.html). No, Mom, that isn't some new electronic gadget - it's happily analog.

I'm going to give it a try as a one-stop location for all my notes - thoughts, sermon notes, to-dos, etc. We'll see how it works. Initially I'm quite impressed with the quality construction of the notebook; the hard covers provide a good writing surface, the paper is quality, the binding is secure yet allows the book to be opened up wide.

We'll see how fast I fill up 192 pages...
