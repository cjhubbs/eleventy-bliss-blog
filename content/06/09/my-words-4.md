Yeah, [4 words, huh Geof?](http://ijsm.org/archives/2006/09/22/words-4/) Hey, I haven't done a meme in a while. Nice to be thought of, too. Anyhow... here goes.

- **Penalty.** Nobody likes penalties. But they make me think of football. My local Hawkeyes are 3-0 so far and are looking forward to a prime-time matchup with Ohio State next week.
- **Vacation.** I just got back from a vacation, but it still never seems like it is enough. I'm taking a day of vacation next weekend to go to the Desiring God conference in Minneapolis. Woohoo!
- **Competition.** I'm only competitive to a point. Yeah, I like to play to win, but I'm usually the one saying hey, give 'em the benefit of the doubt on the close play, rather than making a big stink about it. Now my brother Andrew, there's competitiveness for you.
- **Spelunking.** Oh, sure, Geof. Spelunking?!? Back in high school we went with the youth group one time to a place down in central Texas whose name escapes me. There was a big rock to climb, and we did some rappelling, and then a little sorta quasi-spelunking, though I don't think the bit of crawling we did underground really counts as such.

Now to perpetuate this Friday-afternoon meme to four others...

1. [Dan](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/). He should have something interesting to say.
2. [Roger](http://www.qwertyuppy.com). If he ever comes back to blogging...
3. [Dana](http://hubermomof3.blogspot.com/). She blogs all the time, but I don't know if she'll see this...
4. [Rae](http://rmfo-blogs.com/raekwon/). Have fun, buddy. See you next week!

And the words:

1. Passport
2. Auditorium
3. Odor
4. Enthusiasm
