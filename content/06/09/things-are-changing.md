I made this announcement after both services at Noelridge today. I didn't read from a script, so this isn't verbatim, but is the gist of the message I had for the folks.

> After much prayer, thought, and discussion, I have come to the decision that the best thing for me and my family right now is that I step back from my role as the worship leader here at Noelridge. Now, that's not a fun announcement to make, but let me explain a little bit.  
> <br/>
> The key factor playing into this decision is time. This hit home the most to me when I recently realized that my current life schedule of work and ministry is the same or busier than it was seven years ago when we moved to Cedar Rapids. However, in those seven years God has blessed us with two little girls. And while Becky's schedule has changed drastically since the girls were born, my schedule hasn't changed at all. And it needs to.  
> <br/>
> I also want the time to be able to get involved in community things. My entire social life and structure has been within the church, and that's not good. I need to have the time and freedom to be able to be involved in the "real world", to reach out to my community. You have also entrusted me with a role as an elder here at Noelridge, and I want to make sure I have the time to do that well.  
> <br/>
> Let me emphasize that we are not going anywhere. Noelridge has been a great blessing as our home church for seven years now, and our desire is very much to stay here, I will just be in a different role. Sunday mornings will look at bit different; we have many other talented musicians in the church here who are capable of helping with music, and we will be calling on them. Worship team may also look different for a while, we're still having discussions on that.  
> <br/>
> So thank you for letting me lead these past years, and for understanding as I move to fulfill responsibilities in a new season of my life.

It is a big relief to get this off my chest and officially announced. I'm looking forward to see how God will use the folks in the church to fill in and minister in different ways.
