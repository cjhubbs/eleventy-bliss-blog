This weekend wasn't too busy, but I wasn't on the computer, so no blog updates.

Rebecca and I ran in the Solon Fund Run 5K on Saturday and did OK. I didn't hit my goal of sub-30-minutes; I finished in 31:12. I'll blame it on a 10 mph headwind and a long uphill the last half mile. Still, it was a lot of fun, and I'm looking for another race to sign up for yet this fall. I'll do a full post with pictures when I get the chance.

Watched a bunch of football over the weekend, the Hawkeyes won, setting up a bit showdown with Ohio State in a couple of weeks, but the Huskers couldn't score the upset over USC. Not that I expected them too, but it would've been cool.

Now it's Monday and back-to-work. I'm going to start working on some new stuff, though, so that should be interesting. Gotta brush up on my C++ coding skills - haven't used them since school!

Oh, and I'm looking forward to next weekend - I'll be heading up to Minneapolis along with Pastor Richard to the [Desiring God 2006 National Conference](http://www.desiringgod.org/Events/NationalConferences/Archives/2006/). The list of speakers:

- David Wells
- Don Carson
- Voddie Baucham
- Tim Keller
- Mark Driscoll

And of course John Piper. I can't wait.
