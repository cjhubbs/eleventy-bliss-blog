Jonah Goldberg holds the title of "Chris's Favorite Columnist", hands down. In days past, Peggy Noonan might have given him a run, but no longer. His columns these past few months have been just brilliant. And there's [another good one today](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGQxZmE2MmNlNzI3MDljYmZjZTQ0NTZiZDkxMGM1ZmM=) on NRO. In it, Mr. Goldberg discusses possible outcomes if Democrats would take control of the House in the mid-term elections. He also notes that being the party in power isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be:

> Republican control of the White House and Congress hasn’t resulted in lights being turned off in Cabinet agencies or enormous garage sales of office furniture. Instead, Uncle Sam is still looking like Marlon Brando at the end of his career: bloated, sweaty, and slow moving. The GOP has become a Brando-like parody of its former self, reading its lines about cutting government without plausibility or passion.
> 
> The rub of it, from a conservative perspective, is that Republican control of the House doesn’t equal conservative control. It may not seem that way to liberals who think Joe Lieberman is right wing, but from the vantage point of the conservative movement, GOP dominance has been an enormous disappointment — good judicial appointments and tax cuts not withstanding. Our hopeful joy upon the 1994 takeover of Congress was like finding a new pony by the Christmas tree. Now it’s more like finding it slumped over dead on top of the presents.

Good stuff. Go read the whole thing.
