It's gonna be a slow week here on my blog. I'm in town today, but tomorrow we're leaving town for a few days of much-needed vacation. We'll be leaving the kiddos with my folks and then heading to Wisconsin Dells for two nights. It will be glorious.

Sunday night's concert went well; we played about 80 minutes of music and, from what I am told, it sounded quite good. The recording we made wasn't so good; we don't have a compressor in the system and the signal was so strong that many of the songs we just overloaded the recorder. Still, I guess it's better than nothing.

If I get some time tonight or tomorrow I'll post some of the pictures [my sister](http://thehubbs.net/rebecca/) took, and maybe a recording of one of the songs.
