Last night I was headed to bed at a relatively early hour, and as I prepared to go to sleep I decided I'd get up and run this morning. I haven't run much lately, and I need to. This morning was going to be relatively warm, good for running.

Then the Bears staged an amazing comeback and won the football game. I _had_ to keep watching. The game ended at 11 PM, I figured I'd still be OK.

Then Laura woke up at 3 AM. And again at 4:30 AM. She pitched a fit when I told her she had to go back to sleep. I left her in her crib. At 5:00 she was back awake. So I brought her into our bed. She was awake until 5:30 when I finally got up to get ready for work. By 6:20 when I was leaving the house she was finally sleeping. Hopefully she sleeps in a while.

Needless to say, I didn't get any running done this morning. And I think I'll be finding something to drink with caffine in it here very soon now.

Children are an amazing blessing. But that doesn't mean they won't keep you up at night one way or another. :-)
