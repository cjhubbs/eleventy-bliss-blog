It's been almost a month since the last one, and while I think I lost a few good links in the FeedLounge to Google Reader transition, I still have some good stuff to share.

(Actually, I didn't lose any - but I'm too lazy to go dig out my text file of links and find the good ones. Sorry.)

So, here they are, in sort of a serious-to-non-serious order. Enjoy!
