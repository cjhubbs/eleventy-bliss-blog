[My mother-in-law](http://thehubbs.net/bobandcarol/) [left a comment](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/10/16/yep-thats-me/#comment-5395) a few days ago letting me know that the sidebar doesn't show up correctly for her. I'm assuming this is because she's using Internet Explorer 6. So, I sat down tonight to fix it. But first, I thought, let's download the brand-spanking-new IE7 and see what it looks like.

So, one download and a loooooong install later, I check it in IE7... and it looks just fine. So, they fixed something in there somewhere that makes this place look a lot nicer. Kind of them, huh? So I won't bother trying to fix the theme now for IE6. Mom-in-law Carol, of course you should be using [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com), but if you're gonna use IE, just wait for your IE7 update and then you'll see my blog in all the beauty it's designed to have. :-)
