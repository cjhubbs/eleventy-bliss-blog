Google Reader has fixed one of the major annoyances I had with it. Until today, when you subscribed to a new feed, it left it uncategorized; then you had to go to a separate screen and choose where you wanted to file that feed. Too many steps.

This morning when I subscribed to a feed, it gave me a little bar at the top of the screen asking which folder I wanted to file it in. Wonderful! Much, much better.

Now if only I could sort oldest-to-newest...
