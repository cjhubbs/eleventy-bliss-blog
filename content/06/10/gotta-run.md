I got out for a run yesterday afternoon - probably the first time in 2 weeks that I've run. It feels good to be a little bit sore this morning. It's going to be hard to get too motivated to run these next few days - it's gonna be cold and windy. But we just got a membership to the MAC (a local gym) so I'll be using it instead.

Within the next month they should have the satellite MAC complete and open; it's going to be only about a mile from home. And my good friend and former associate pastor John Wilbur will be co-managing it. Excellent. They are also bragging about individual 19" LCD TVs on _every treadmill and elliptical_. Almost sounds like overkill... almost.

I guess my 5K race running is done for the fall; the only ones remaining around here are on Sunday mornings. Grrrr. I'll have to keep busy on the treadmills over the winter and then I'll be ready for some spring races. I could get into this running stuff.
