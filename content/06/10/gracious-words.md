In reply to [the "controversy" of John Piper's comments](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/10/01/dg2006-piper-rebukes-driscolls-cleverness/) regarding Mark Driscoll at the DG2006 conference, Driscoll has graciously [posted an email interaction](http://theresurgence.com/md_blog_2006-10-04_thank_you_dr_john_piper) between him and Dr. Piper. A brief quote:

> As far as your comments regarding me, I welcome them but must confess that maybe telling me them before they get sent out to cyber world like fresh meat to feed all my critics would be preferable. Either way, I love, respect, and appreciate you very much and have an open ear for any counsel or criticism from you. Perhaps some day I can take a few minutes to tell you my life story as it may help to explain a bit of who I am and make our friendship even simpler. It was a tremendous honor to be in the company of men I have learned much from over the years and made the celebration of 10 years in ministry all the more memorable. This past weekend was one of the highlights of my life. So, thank you very much and I pray you get some rest after the conference.

Praise God for gracious servants who are willing to openly share their lives with us. Blessings on both Dr. Piper and Pastor Driscoll.
