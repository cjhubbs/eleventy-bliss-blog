Andrew helped me lead worship at [Noelridge](http://www.noelridge.org) this morning, and for the special number we pulled out [Jeremy Casella's](http://www.jeremycasella.com) wonderful setting of _Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah_. I love Jeremy's tune - so plaintive and searching, embodying the spirit of the lyrics in a way that the old hymntune just fails to do.

The recording quality is good - we got our new digital recorder last week and it was worth every penny. Musically we're OK, but not great; we fight for rhythms a little bit. Anyhow, if you're still interested enough to listen to it, use the player below.
