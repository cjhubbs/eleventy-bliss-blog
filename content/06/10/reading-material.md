I just posted a short piece on our church website about blogging and how to get started reading blogs. If you're reading this, you're already reading blogs, so you don't need the first part of the article. However, I thought I'd cross-post some of my reading list here; you have probably read some of these blogs already, but there may be a new one or two in the list. Enjoy!

[Between Two Worlds](http://theologica.blogspot.com/) - Justin Taylor is an editor at Crossway Books, and was before that a staff member at John Piper's Desiring God Ministries. Justin is a frequent and informative blogger. This is a must-read blog.  
  

[Colossians 3:16](http://www.colossiansthreesixteen.com/) - This blog is written by the pastor of a church very near the town where I lived in Texas. He writes about music, theology, and has a weekly roundup that includes poetry!  
  

[Corner Table Online](http://cornertableonline.com/) - This blog is written by some friends of mine. Their self-description: "We are young. We are writers. We are not satisfied with the way life is covered by the current crop of culture publications. We thought we could do better." Worth reading.  
  

[Internet Monk](http://www.internetmonk.com/) - Michael Spencer is a Baptist pastor and teacher at a Baptist school in Kentucky. He is often controversial, but I have resonated more with and found more insight in his writing than in any other blogger of late.  
  

[Sacred Journey](http://foolishsage.com/) - Mark Traphagen is a forty-something seminary student in Philadelphia. He writes thoughtfully and shares from his life.  
  

[Worship Matters](http://worshipmatters.blogs.com/bobkauflin/) - Bob Kauflin is a long-time songwriter and musician. He is now the worship pastor at Sovereign Grace church outside of Washington, DC. He has good insights on doing music ministry.  
  

[Way Over Yonder In The Minor Key](http://thehubbs.net/chris) - OK, I have to plug my own blog here. Definitely the weakest of all that have been listed here... but you'll find out a little more about me.
