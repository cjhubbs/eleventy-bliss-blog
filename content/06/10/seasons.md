Yard work isn't my favorite task; it's one of those things that gets done because it needs to be done, not because I really want to do it. But there is something increasingly pleasant about the pattern of life as I see it develop year after year. This will be our third autumn in this house, and so the third season of cold afternoons raking until dark, brisk Saturdays cleaning out gutters, and warm cups of tea waiting for me back in the house. When the raking gets long I will take comfort in the knowledge that in just a few weeks all the leaves will have fallen, the bags will have been collected, and all that will remain in this year's outdoor maintenance is to prepare the snowblower for its season of work.

They say time speeds up as you get older, and I can understand why they say so. Children have a particular way of making time fly. Wasn't it just yesterday that little girl was born? Today she sits up on her own, sports two teeth, and grabs everything in sight. Wasn't it just recently I graduated from college? And yet the new grads at work this year look like mere children. When did I get old? What I am starting to see, though, is the joy in the patterns of life across the years.

Laura is old enough to attend Sunday School this fall, and she came up a few weeks ago chattering "day, night. day, night". She's learned about all the other things God created, too, but she has been stuck on "day, night". At night when we pray I've been reinforcing to her that we're praying to God who made day and night, sun, moon and stars (also favorites of hers!), and who made her. At her young age, I'm sure "day, night" seems like a long time; but even now she can start to learn the patterns that God has so beautifully designed for us. And before too long she'll be out helping rake the leaves, mow the grass, and shovel the snow.

Writing this suddenly I feel old. I can take some short-lived comfort in the knowledge that my 30th birthday is still nearly 5 months off, but I know that it will come all too soon. (Some of my readers will say that 30 isn't old - humor me for a minute.) I can be content, though, in knowing that the God who designs and upholds the days, seasons, and years has designed them for me, and me for them. And I can enjoy living them and passing the lessons of life on to my little girls. God is good.
