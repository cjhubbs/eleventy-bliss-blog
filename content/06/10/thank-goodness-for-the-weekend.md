It's managed to be a busy week, but now the weekend is upon us. Finally!

This afternoon Becky and I are headed to the MAC to play some racquetball, then we'll go (with the girls) out for supper and down to the [coffeehouse](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com) to hear Billy Heller - first time in a long time to hear him!

Nothing really scheduled for Saturday. Sunday is church and then possibly a babysitter and a date with Becky! Gotta love the weekend.
