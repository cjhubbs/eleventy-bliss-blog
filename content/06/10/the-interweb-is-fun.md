So yesterday after church [I posted a recording of Andrew and me](/06/10/music-for-your-sunday/) singing a song in church.

Talking to Andrew later in the afternoon, apparently shortly after lunch he gets a call from his girlfriend in Portland. She says "hi, how ya doin, have you heard this song before?" And then he recognizes the song she's playing him... yep, it's that song we did just hours before. He was dumbfounded. "We just sang that song in church this morning," he spluttered. Then he realized. I had already posted it on my blog, she had already read it, and she was calling to let him know. Too cool.

Oh, and Heather, if you read this, leave a comment or something to say hi. :-)
