So I don't listen to Christian radio any more, but Becky had it on in the van over the weekend, and on Sunday morning when I started the van to head to church, this song came on, and it's driving me crazy. I've been frustrated with shallow and trite lyrics before, but I think this song takes the cake. To be fair, I'll quote the whole song:

> Some people tell me that I look kind of funny  
> My nose is red and the braces didn't work at all  
> They say the clothes I wear are all out of fashion  
> I don't fit in and should be shopping at a different mall  
> I studied classical piano when I could've been playing guitar  
> I used to drive an El Camino and I'm not even sure it's a car
> <br/>
> (chorus)  
> I'm not cool but that's okay  
> My God loves me anyway  
> I'm not cool but that's alright  
> I'm still precious in His sight  
> I'm not cool but I don't care  
> How I'm supposed to do my hair  
> I'm not cool but that's okay  
> My God loves me anyway  
> <br/>
> It doesn't matter if I know all the lingo  
> He doesn't mind if I'm not hanging with a certain crowd  
> Some people still believe in building image  
â‰¥ But I am fine and that's a worry I can do without  
> I used to wish I was athletic but football was never my game  
> I met some friends in mathematics but no one can spell my last name  
> <br/>
> chorus  
> <br/>
> He says that I am one of a kind  
> And I don't have to try to be somebody else  
> He believes in me and says I'm free to be myself  
> I can be myself  
> <br/>
> (_I'm Not Cool_ - Scott Krippayne)

Becky has warned me that ripping on this song will just make me come across as a music snob. I'm probably guilty as charged... but I've gotta say _something_. In no particular order:

First thought: **This could be the theme song for all of Christian Radio these days.** The music they play is so out-of-date and repetitive... don't get me started. It's the same stuff I was hearing on Christian radio when I listened to it back in high school. And I graduated high school in 1995.

Second thought: **There's a fine line between saying "it's OK if I'm not cool" and saying "I don't need to be culturally relevant".** I understand what Krippayne is trying to say with the song. It's supposed to be an encouragement to that poor socially-inept person who feels "uncool" and rejected by their peers. OK, great. But it's a very short trip from that to saying "it doesn't matter whether I'm in touch culturally or not", which is a much shakier proposition. It seems to me that we _do_ need to be culturally relevant; we're not doing the Gospel any favors by intimating that only geeks and losers believe. Yeah, there's a balance to be struck, but this song takes me way out past the edge of where I'm comfortable balancing.

Third thought: **If it's really OK to be uncool, why are the words and music written in a style that is attempting to be contemporary?** Why not write it as a Gregorian chant or as Uzbekistani folk music or as hideous 70's disco? Apparently it's OK to be uncool unless you're a CCM musician. Then you've gotta try to be, but the odds are you'll fail miserably.

I can't deny that the basic message of the song ("God loves me just as I am") is true; it's really the insipidity that kills me. Let me share, in closing, a song that does a far better job at eloquently sharing the wonder of God's love for us. Brother Scott, you might take a lesson or two from [Andrew Peterson](http://www.andrew-peterson.com/lyrics.php?id=36).

> What's that on the ground?  
> It's what's left of my heart  
> Somebody named Jesus  
> Broke it to pieces  
> And planted the shards  
> <br/>
> And they're coming up green  
> They're coming in bloom  
> I can hardly believe  
> This is all coming true  
> <br/>
> Just as I am and just as I was  
> Just as I will be He loves me, He does  
> He showed me the day that He shed His own blood  
> He loves me, oh, He loves me, He does  
> <br/>
> All of my life I've held on to this fear  
> Its thistles and vines  
> Ensnare and entwine  
> What flowers appeared  
> <br/>
> It's the fear that I'll fall  
> One too many times  
> It's the fear that His love  
> Is no better than mine  
> <br/>
> It's time now to harvest  
> What little that grew  
> This man they call Jesus  
> Who planted the seeds  
> Has come for the fruit  
> <br/>
> And the best that I've got  
> Isn't nearly enough  
> He's glad for the crop  
> But it's me that He loves  
> <br/>
> Just as I am and just as I was  
> Just as I will be He loves me, He does  
> The same as the day that He shed His own blood  
> He loves me, oh, He loves me, He does  
> <br/>
> (_Just As I Am_ - Andrew Peterson)
