You may notice a new face staring at you when you visit my blog - I modified my theme slightly to include a small picture of myself. There's also a link to a little "About Me" page if you're really interested. I figured the site could use a bit of a personal touch; yeah, there's a real person writing these posts, and yeah, he looks kinda funny. Anyhow, thanks to all of you for reading, please stop back, and don't forget to leave comments!
