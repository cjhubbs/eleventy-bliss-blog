Tomorrow morning Becky will be taking off for Chicago to spend a weekend with her friend Juanita who is up here visiting to celebrate her (Juanita's) 30th birthday. They're going to see Blue Man Group while they're in town, which makes me a bit jealous. But that's cool.

So, from Friday morning until Sunday afternoon, I will be spending a lot of quality time with my two little girls. (I will get a little break on Friday night when my sister watches the kids while my brother and I go to a [Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com) house show...) Everyone who hears that I've got the kids for the weekend asks me if I think I'll survive. I'm not quite sure what the big deal is - isn't a Dad supposed to be able to manage for a day or two with the wife gone? Sure, we'll be ready to have Becky back on Sunday, but I'm glad she can go. Goodness knows I'm gone often enough. Seems only fair that she should get to go when the occasions arise.

I sense a Happy Meal in Laura's future for this weekend. :-)
