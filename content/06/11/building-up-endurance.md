So how was your Thanksgiving? We spent the weekend in Wisconsin with my family at my parents' place. It was the first time we've had everybody together in about a year. We ate far too much, shopped a little, played lots of Speed Scrabble, and I did some reading. We made it home last night about 5 PM, in time to get unpacked and get the girls to bed. It was a great time, wonderful to see everybody again.

Becky says we're building up endurance for road trips over the next month or so. The trip to Wisconsin is only about a three-hour drive. Not too bad. Now this Friday we're headed for Omaha (to see the Andrew Peterson Christmas concert!), which is just over four hours away. But those drives will all be wimpy in comparison to the road trip we'll be taking in three weeks, a mere 20 hours to the great state of North Carolina. Fortunately, we'll split it up over 3 days on the way down there, two 10-hour days plus a day in Nashville in between driving. By the time we get home on New Years' we'll be ready to stay home for a while, methinks.

I should note that I am not opposed to road trips - [I have taken long ones in the past](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/06/28/road-trip-andy-o-cd-release-show/). But it'll be a whole different experience with a 2-and-a-half-year-old and a nine-month-old occupying the two back seats in the van. We will get some mileage out of the portable DVD player for sure.

_The road goes ever on and on..._
