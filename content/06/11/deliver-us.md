Our enemy, our captor is no Pharoah on the Nile Our toil is neither mud, nor brick, nor sand. Our ankles bear no callouses from chains, yet, Lord, we're bound Imprisoned here we dwell in our own land

Deliver us, deliver us, oh Yahweh hear our cry And gather us beneath Your wings tonight.

Our sins they are more numerous than all the lambs we've slain Our shackles, they were made with our own hands Our toil is our atonement, and our freedom Yours to give So Yahweh, break this silence if You can...

Deliver us, deliver us, oh Yahweh hear our cry And gather us beneath Your wings tonight, Deliver us, deliver us, oh Yahweh hear our cry And gather us beneath Your wings tonight.

_Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often I have longed To gather you beneath my gentle wings..._

_"Deliver Us"_ - [Andrew Peterson](http://www.andrew-peterson.com), from _Behold the Lamb of God: The True Tall tale of the Coming of Christ_
