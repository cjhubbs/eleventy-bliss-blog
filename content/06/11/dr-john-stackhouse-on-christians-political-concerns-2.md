Dr. John Stackhouse of [Regent College](http://www.regent-college.edu/) in Vancouver, BC, is in Cedar Rapids this weekend speaking. He'll be at [Coe College](http://www.coe.edu) tonight, First Lutheran Church tomorrow night, and then at [Noelridge](http://www.noelridge.org) and First Lutheran on Sunday morning. (Visit [recminusa.org](http://www.recminusa.org) for more details.)

I got to meet him at lunch today. I was invited to a regular lunch meeting that my pastor has with some musician-types each Thursday, and Dr. Stackhouse was invited to join us all for lunch. He is a fascinating man; seeming to be equally conversant in music, politics, religion, and philosophy, he bantered with the group all the while engaging us in some serious thought.

At one point the discussion turned to politics, and one of the regulars was lamenting that so many people have started to view politics as single-issues; they'll make their voting decision based strictly on a candidate's view on, say, abortion, or gay rights. It's frustrating to those of us who think there are multiple issues that are important. Dr. Stackhouse agreed that it is very difficult; in reality there may be 30 or 40 issues that a thinking person could be versed on, and vote around. What he suggested, though, was that pastors and other leaders should encourage their people to think around a rather short list, perhaps five or six issues that as Christians we should care about.

He only listed two for us:

- How will this issue affect the poor?
- How will this issue affect our ability to freely share the gospel?

He suggested that there might be just a few more. What do you think? Is this a reasonable framework around which to decide how votes will be cast? What items would you add to the list?
