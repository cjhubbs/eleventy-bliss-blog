The past two mornings Laura has decided there was a need to wake up about ten minutes to five; both times she had lost her pacifier and couldn't get back to sleep. (We need to find the little attachment device for it again.) Both days this has been about 20 minutes before my alarm was set to go off anyway. Amazingly I'm not too tired yet from the lack of sleep.

What has been nice is that it's had me up and ready to go hit the mini-MAC in the mornings. The MAC is our local athletic club, and while they chintz on [their website](http://the-mac0.tripod.com/) (it's hosted for free on... wait for it... [Tripod](http://www.tripod.com)! What is this, 1996?), their club locations are nothing to sneeze at. They just opened an "express" MAC about a mile from our house. You get a key card and 24/7 access. There are 8 or so each of treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes, and then a full Nautilus weight set. Each of the aerobic machines has a 13-inch LCD TV attached so you can plug in your headphones and choose your own channel. So far it's worked pretty well to start the morning with a quick trip over to the MAC and a half hour on some machine. I did the elliptical this morning and I'm starting to feel it.

It's now approaching 7:30 and the office is finally starting to wake up. I love getting in at 6:45 and having some quiet time to work in the mornings. I also love the fact that it facilitates my leaving work around 3:15 in the afternoon. :-) Having two girls under 3 years old has pretty much prevented any sleeping in these days, but I'm learning that it's an OK thing - a morning is a terrible thing to waste.
