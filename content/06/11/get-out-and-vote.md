Yep, it's election day. I can't say I'm too excited about any of the slate of candidates I have to vote for here in Iowa; some of the locals are probably alright, but even at the state level they've been slinging mud for so many weeks now I have a bad taste in my mouth - something akin to that nasty pastiness you get when sleeping with your mouth open all night when your nose is clogged. Yecch.

Still, I'll be heading to the polling place after work to do my part as a citizen. I urge you to do the same.

Note to my dad, who's running the poll for his township in Wisconsin: hope it goes well.
