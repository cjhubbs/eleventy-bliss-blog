Happy Birthday today to my father, Don Hubbs, piano technician and town clerk _extrordinaire_. Relationships with your parents as you get older are funny things; somewhere in there they make the move from being authorities whom you put up with to being wise older people who you can learn so much from. I can't pinpoint the day that my perspective changed, but I know that now I am benefiting from the wisdom and example of my dad.

Thanks, Dad, for being a good one!
