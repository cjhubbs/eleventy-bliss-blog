My dear mother celebrates her birthday today. I should be a good son and not tell how old she is, so I'll tell a story instead. Back when Mom turned 40, she was hoping to keep it quiet and under wraps - no need to make a big scene. But it was a Wednesday, and as we showed up at church for supper and AWANA, one of us kids (and I'll blame it on my brother here, since I don't really remember who it was) ran into the fellowship hall where everyone was eating and made it known in a loud voice that "Mom is 40 today!". So much for secrecy.

And that seems like a long time ago, though it was only... um... 15 years ago, I guess. :-)

Hope you have a great day, Mom!
