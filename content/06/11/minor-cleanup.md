If you're really paying attention, you'll notice I tweaked a couple things in my blog stylesheet. I modified the blockquotes a bit so that they're more visible, and also so they're aligned correctly when used within comments.

This theme works really well for me, so I'm happy to just tweak it here and there to make some small improvements. :-)
