This Sunday will be my last Sunday to lead worship at [Noelridge](http://www.noelridge.org) for a while. It has been a while since [I made the official announcement](/06/09/things-are-changing/), and I think in the interim some good strides have been made to get things organized and prepared for my departure. I'm sure there will still be some kinks to work out, some things I've forgotten and the like, but they'll get the figured out, and I'll be available to answer questions.

I'm looking forward to the break. Suddenly my Monday afternoons are free from staff meetings (though I may still attend from time to time), my Tuesday nights are free from planning services, my Wednesday nights are free from worship team practice, and my Sunday mornings are now flexible so I can attend one service of my choice. There will definitely be some schedule adjustment, I think for the better.

So, this Sunday is the last one. We're celebrating the church's 50th anniversary this week. We'll have a few of the former pastors in attendance, and a bunch of old-timers. Should be a neat time.
