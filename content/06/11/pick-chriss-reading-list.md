Those of you who know me know that I am a voracious reader. (Those of you who don't know me just found out.) Every night for many years I have spent my last waking hour in bed reading some book or another. (If the book is too interesting, I spend a few of my last waking hours in bed... and often end up short on sleep as a result.) I enjoy many genres, but find myself most drawn to history, theology, science fiction (but not the fantasy branch of sci-fi so much), and then military/adventure novels. I was big into Tom Clancy as a kid, and branched out to similar authors when Clancy's pen dried up.

I average 1 or 2 books per week, depending on how busy my week is. Lately, though, I have become weary of my regular diet of mindless adventure. Much of it is tired retreads. I feel like I'm wasting my time. Back at the DG2006 conference I bought G. K. Chesterton's _[The Everlasting Man](http://www.amazon.com/Everlasting-Man-G-K-Chesterton/dp/0898704448/sr=8-1/qid=1163513393/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0755405-0088815?ie=UTF8&s=books)_ and I'm enjoying it quite a lot. But it, too, will soon join the ranks of books I've already read, and I'll be looking for something else.

So here's the deal. Do you have any books to recommend that I read? They could be fiction, non-fiction, whatever. Just something you think I'd enjoy or benefit from. Leave a comment with the name and author of the book. In return, I will find them at the local library, read them, and then post my thoughts about the book. Sound like a plan?
