Well, that Happy Meal hasn't materialized in Laura's future yet. Becky got sick with a nasty fever and such on Thursday, so she had to cancel her trip to Chicago for this weekend. I know she was very disappointed, but what can you do?

She did get to come along, though, to a [Randall Goodgame](http://www.randallgoodgame.com) house show last night, and it was excellent. I much prefer to hear Randall's music live rather than from his CDs - it's a whole different sound, less production, less extra instruments. He and his wife Amy did most of the songs with just a guitar, and it sounded great. He also did several piano songs, showing off his skill as a jazz pianist, and then left no eye dry with a stunning late-night piano version of _Next To You_. I found that I have his recorded version of the song on a CD at home, but with the upped tempo, drum track, and production, it sounds nothing like the version we heard last night. So Randall, buddy, think about recording an album that sounds a little more like your live stuff sometime, huh? Just a thought.

It has been a lazy sleep-in morning here this morning, and will continue to be a lazy Saturday. I sense some football games on TV in my future...
