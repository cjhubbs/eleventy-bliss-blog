It's been far too long since I've written much here on the blog; it's been a busy week or two. While not a full remedy, a brief update will at least catch you up to speed on Chris's life in December of 2006.

**Christmas Shopping:** I have finished buying for four people; I have three left to buy for. I know pretty much what I want to buy, just haven't gotten to the store yet. I'll try to finish up early this week; that'll be the earliest I've ever finished Christmas shopping, I'm sure.

**Book Reviews:** For those of you who listed books for my reading list, I haven't forgotten you. I'm still working through _The Russian Debutante's Handbook_ as recommended by Geof Morris. I nearly finished it last night, but sleep got the better of me. It's due back at the library tomorrow, so I better finish it up tonight. It's been an enjoyable read, definitely a change from my usual reading fare.

**Church Stuff:** I haven't led music in a month now, and I finally realized yesterday how nice the break has been. This was the first Sunday that I actually just showed up for church without giving any thought or concern to whether the music team was lined up and prepared. And it went just fine. Next week will break the streak; I will be leading next Sunday.

**Travel Plans:** We leave a week from Wednesday (the 20th) for North Carolina. We will swing through Nashville to see Becky's brother and then head to Charlotte to see Becky's folks and sister/brother-in-law/niece. Should be a fun time, if the 20-hour drive doesn't kill us. :-) We should be back home by the 30th or 31st.

Christmas break should provide some more time for posting - I'll try, I promise! :-)
