Day 3 was another travel day; Nashville, TN to Waxhaw, NC. It doesn't look that long on the map, but it winds through the mountains a good bit, which makes it longer. It's a very pretty drive.

We got packed up and left the Opryland resort about 8:30. Taking I-40 east, we headed through Knoxville and then wound our way through the mountains to Asheville, NC. It was rainy and foggy all day, which made for some beautiful views of clouds hanging low in the mountain valleys, but it also made for some difficult driving. Still, we made it to Charlotte in time for supper and then drove the 40 minutes on to Waxhaw to see Becky's folks.

We hung out at their apartment for a little while and had some dessert (Laura just loves her ice cream!), then they took us over to the little JAARS apartment that we're staying in. The JAARS headquarters here actually is set up with several lodges and apartments to house folks that come in for training and the like. They're also available for visitors, which works quite well for us. We're actually in an apartment that has two bedrooms, one bath, living room, dining room, and small kitchen. Laura slept in a real twin-sized bed, a real step up from her toddler bed at home. She did really well. It's nice to have a little home-away-from-home where we can just settle down at night. (It even has DSL so I can get my internet fix!)

Fortunately we won't be doing much more driving for a day or two; Sunday we'll head into Charlotte for church, then Monday we head up to Conover to visit Ernie, Faith, and Brandy for Christmas. I'll try to keep my blog posts up-to-date since I know some of my family will be reading them while they're together in Chicago at Ryan's place. Hi guys!
