December 27th found us hanging out with Becky's family in the morning, then going in to Charlotte in the afternoon. Becky's Mom's 64th birthday was on the 27th, so we took her out to dinner. Actually, Faith, Ernie, and Brandi surprised her, too, by meeting us for dinner. We had a fun time, and the food was excellent. Then it was off to a mall for a little post-Christmas shopping.

To my surprise, Blockbuster allowed me to return the previously-viewed DVDs I'd gotten for Christmas. So, I managed to return them and then order the complete _Firefly_ series on DVD for about the same price. Woohoo!

Only a few more trip days to go...
