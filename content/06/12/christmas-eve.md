Sunday morning of our trip brought us to [Calvary Church](http://www.calvarychurch.com/) in Charlotte for the Sunday morning service. It is Becky's folks' church, and she attended and was an intern there while in college. Then in 1998 we got married in the chapel there... so I guess we have a little history at the church. :-) We got there early so Becky could see a few people she hasn't seen in a while... and of course she could show off the girls.

After church we pigged out on Sonny's BBQ, which has some phenomenal sweet tea. Then it was back to Waxhaw for an afternoon nap, and then the traditional Christmas Eve feast with Becky's folks. Then it was off to bed for the girls as we packed up to head to Faith & Ernie's for Christmas...
