Finally! This was my biggest gripe with Google Reader up until now; the only chronological sort option was newest-to-oldest. But I don't want to read that way; especially on the conversational blogs that I'm subscribed to, I want to read the conversation in order the way it happened - oldest-to-newest.

So I rejoiced this morning when I saw on the official Google Reader blog that [they have now added an oldest-to-newest sort option](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/12/dwelling-on-past.html). Woohoo!
