The long-awaited Christmas break is finally here! Tonight we're loading the van, and tomorrow morning we head out bright and early for our Christmas visit to see Becky's family in Tennessee and North Carolina.

Wednesday will take us to Nashville. We'll spend all day Thursday there with her brother Bobby and his family, then Friday morning we'll take off for North Carolina. We'll spend the next several days alternating between Becky's folks' place in Waxhaw and her sister's place in Conover. We'll meet some weird internet friends on Thursday night in Charlotte, then Friday morning we head back home, taking two days to get back to Iowa. At the moment we're planning on overnighting in Dayton, OH on the way back.

It'll be good to get away from work for a couple of weeks, spend some major time with Becky and the girls, see some of her family that we haven't seen in a long time. Hey, I'll probably post more often over the next two weeks than I usually do - lots of good chances to take pictures and lots of new stories to tell.
