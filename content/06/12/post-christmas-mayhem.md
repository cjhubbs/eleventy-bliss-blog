The day after Christmas found us trying to sleep off all that food we ate the day before. :-) We enjoyed leftovers for breakfast and lunch, again ate too much food. We played Upwards for the first time. It's like Scrabble, but gives you the opportunity to stack letters on top of other letters to make new words... kinda fun.

We took a little walk and Brandi drove herself and Laura around the yard in her little battery-powered Corvette.

Then late afternoon came and it was time to pack up and head back to Waxhaw. We just barely fit everything into the Suburban. Traffic was kinda heavy but we made it back and crashed. Another enjoyable day. Pictures below.
