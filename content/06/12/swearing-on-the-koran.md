[My mother-in-law asked the other day](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/12/01/links-for-2006-12-01/#comment-6121) what I thought about [this recent news story](http://www.washtimes.com/upi/20061202-075343-6941r.htm). In brief: Newly elected to the House of Representatives, Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison has declared that when he is sworn in on January 4th, he will take the oath of office with his hand on a Koran instead of a Bible. Ellison is the first Muslim ever elected to Congress.

There have been varying reactions to Ellison's decision. The loudest has been [Dennis Prager on townhall.com](http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/DennisPrager/2006/11/28/america,_not_keith_ellison,_decides_what_book_a_congressman_takes_his_oath_on), who declares that Ellison "...should not be allowed to do so -- not because of any American hostility to the Koran, but because the act undermines American civilization." A little more:

> Forgive me, but America should not give a hoot what Keith Ellison's favorite book is. Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don't serve in Congress. In your personal life, we will fight for your right to prefer any other book. We will even fight for your right to publish cartoons mocking our Bible. But, Mr. Ellison, America, not you, decides on what book its public servants take their oath.

Yesterday I was forwarded an email from the [American Family Association](http://www.afa.net/aa112806_2.asp) that quoted the Prager column and then asked all the readers to

> 1\. Send an email asking your U.S. Representative and Senators to pass a law making the Bible the book used in the swearing-in ceremony of Representatives and Senators.
> 
> 2\. Forward this email to your friends and family today!

So what is my reaction to all this?

Let's deal with the easy one first. The AFA's suggestion is clearly ridiculous. Any law passed by Congress requiring the oath to be taken on a Bible would be summarily rejected by the Supreme Court as an unconstitutional establishment of religion, and rightly so. Let's just reverse the situation for a moment. Suppose a congressional majority of Muslims arose. Would I think it were then OK for them to mandate that all oaths be taken with a hand on the Koran? Of course not. Hence our protection of religious freedoms in the Constitution.

So then to the next question: what opinion do I have about Mr. Ellison's intention? Let's back up and look at the history of oath-taking in the USA. I'm sure I could go back further, but it's easy to note that George Washington took the presidential oath of office on a Bible. Each President since then has taken the oath in similar fashion. The Bible is today used for oaths in a multitude of other circumstances, local and state offices, courtrooms.

In the initial case, President Washington used the Bible because he viewed it as a sacred book, and placing his hand on the Bible further solemnized the oath. Given the United States' Christian heritage, this understandably became a tradition that continues to this day. My fear, though, is that somewhere through the years the solemnity imbued by the sacred text has faded into a tradition that carries little of its original weight. Let's be certain of this: I'm all for politicians keeping their word. Too many these days seem to lose their care for ethics and the truth once they reach Washington; if any action can reinforce to them the need to keep their oath, so much the better. But it seems to me that if the Bible is being used simply as a traditional prop by those who don't reverence it, it is more dishonoring than honoring to the Book. As one who believes the Bible to be the Word of God, that bothers me.

So where does that leave us? I have come to the conclusion that I don't really care. I want Rep. Ellison and each of his fellow congressmen to honor the oaths that they take. If Rep. Ellison believes that the Koran will further solemnize his oath, I don't have a problem with it. If a Christian congressman wants to use the Bible to solemnize his oath, he should use it. Personally, I'd prefer that if a person doesn't respect or revere the Bible, they not use it at all. Let's not turn the Holy Book into a prop.
