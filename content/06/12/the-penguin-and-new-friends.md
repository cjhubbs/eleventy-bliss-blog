Thursday was get-ready-to-head-home day. We picked up a cartop carrier that Ernie had salvaged for us. It is in excellent shape, and with all the post-Christmas shopping Becky did, it's a good thing we have it! There's no way we'd have fit all the stuff into the van. Then we started packing up to go home. Can't believe we brought so much stuff along. Seriously, we took the back seat out of the Caravan, and it's still packed up nearly to the ceiling, then we have the cartop carrier almost full, too. Goodness.

Thursday evening we headed in to Charlotte to meet some of our "weird internet friends" for supper and to hang out. We met Brandon, his wife Sarah, and Andrea at [The Penguin](http://www.penguindrivein.com/) near downtown Charlotte. The Penguin is a nice hole-in-the-wall place; very small, very loud, very eclectic. The jukebox would be playing heavy metal one minute and jazz the next. Very unpredictable. The burgers were good, and the specialty that we had to try was deep-fried dill pickle chips. They were fantastic.

After supper we went back to Brandon and Sarah's apartment for dessert and to watch Brandon's beloved Texas A&M Aggies who were playing Cal in a bowl game. The Aggies ended up losing. Sorry, Brandon. We ended up getting back to Waxhaw about 11 PM. It was a fun night, fun to finally meet some people we interact with online all the time. And yes, they're normal people... not weirdos... just like I'm a normal, non-weird person. Heh. :-)
