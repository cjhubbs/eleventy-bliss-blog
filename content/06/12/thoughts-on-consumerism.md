Found this wonderful little article from Will Willimon entitled ["Resisting the Clutches of Consumerism"](http://willimon.blogspot.com/2006/12/resisting-clutches-of-consumerism.html). A good read, especially this time of year.

> ...the “user friendly” approach to church won’t work. There is no way to entice people off the streets with hymns that are based on advertising jingles and end up with the cross-bearing, self-sacrificial, burden-bearing Jesus. Evangelism cannot be based upon our basic selfishness (“Come to Jesus and get everything you want fixed.”) and end up with anything resembling historic Christianity.

Good stuff, for sure. Go read the whole thing.
