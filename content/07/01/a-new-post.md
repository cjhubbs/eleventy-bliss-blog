If only to get my scary pictures off the top of the blog. :-)

I'm finally back to work today after a 2-week holiday. It was great to be off, but now good to be back to a more normal routine. The last couple of days we've had visitors; my brother Andrew and his girlfriend Heather have been down here and so we've enjoyed time with them and getting to know her. They're headed back to Wisconsin this morning.

The basement is pretty well cleaned up from the [great flood](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2007/01/01/the-great-new-years-eve-flood-of-aught-six/); the last big task required to restore normalcy is to purchase a new printer. Thanks to my brother Aaron, I have a BestBuy gift card just waiting to be used! :-) I think we're going shopping this afternoon.

Last, but not least, it will be good to get back to the gym after a couple weeks of being a lazy bum. Somehow I managed to not gain any weight over the past two weeks, which is a cause for rejoicing. Now I need to work on dropping some more...
