Sometime while we were gone on our Christmas vacation, [our local Krispy Kreme closed down](http://gazetteonline.com/2006/12/27/Home/Businesssection/krispykremeclosing.htm). It opened back in 2000, is only two blocks from our house, and the smell of fresh donuts often wafted over to tantalize us. I have a love-hate relationship with Krispy Kreme donuts; when they're fresh and warm, they're a real treat. Once they've cooled to room temperature, they become a total sugar overload and I am no longer a real fan. But still, I'm sad to see them go.

The local Krispy Kreme franchise owner says that the distributing facilities elsewhere in the state can handle the Cedar Rapids area's distribution needs, and Krispy Kreme donuts will still be available in many retail stores. So people can still get their fix if they really need it... but it won't be the same as driving up to the store in the morning, the smell of donuts in the air, and being offered a free fresh hot glazed donut. Wow, those were good.

On the upside, the news story says they're likely to open an Arby's in the old Krispy Kreme building. That will make Becky very happy. :-)
