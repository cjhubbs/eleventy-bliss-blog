I understand from reading the news that President Bush gave the State of the Union address back on Tuesday night. I skipped it. I actually even avoided it - when I turned the TV on, it was in progress. I flipped to ESPN. This is a departure for me. I have long held great interest in State of the Union (let's just call them SOTU for short) speeches. When I was in high school I used my boom box to record them off the radio onto a cassette so I could listen to them again later. In past years I have sat with rapt attention to the network of my choice and had a thrill of excitement as the Sergeant-at-Arms would walk in and declare, "Mister Speaker, the President of the United States!". But not this year.

I have become disenchanted with politics these days. Not uninterested, mind you; nor would I say that they are unimportant. But I have become disappointed with all of my political leaders and the very system that they operate in. I am not excited about any of the political topics they are pushing. Gone are the days when I thought they might actually do something about Social Security reform. Gone are the hopes that some serious income tax reform might be in the works. Now we're supposed to get excited about a higher minimum wage and even more money for education and social programs.

I have long been a supporter of President Bush. The first ballot I ever cast, back as a high-school student in Texas, included a vote for him to be Governor of Texas. I have voted for him twice in presidential elections. He's made some decisions I've been very happy with. (Nominating John Roberts to the Supreme Court is one of my favorites.) But on fiscal and governance issues, he has disappointed me greatly. Gone are Reagan's conservative ideals of less government, less spending, and lower taxes. Now we just have more programs. Gone are tightly-held ideals of less government regulation and free speech; we just sign McCain-Feingold and let the Supreme Court sort it out. And then there's the war.

I haven't written much about the war here. Initially I was in favor of it. I don't really want to debate that case here now; I thought the president presented a compelling case, and it was good for us to go get rid of Saddam. But the mess we are in now seems more and more troubling. The sad part is that I don't see a good exit strategy. I'm not convinced that sending more troops will help subdue things and finish off the war. (I'm not saying it won't, I'm just not convinced that it will.) But cutting and running isn't a viable option, either. At this point, I'm about out of ideas, other than to pray for wisdom for the leadership and safety for the troops.

I don't know what it's going to take to get me excited about political goings-on again. I'd like to see a real conservative candidate from the Republican party for the 2008 election. If there were some real conservative principles championed, rather than just "my programs will be better than their programs", maybe I'd be more interested. At least the Republicans have a better record on moral issues, though who knows how long that'll last. The key difficulty here is that in our two-party system, my choice is either to vote for the Republican I'm unexcited about, or the Democrat I am even less excited about. And don't start on me about third-party candidates - I know a wasted vote when I see one.

So this is probably as close as I'll come on this blog to a political rant. Feel free to respond and interact. Tell me why I'm wrong (or right), and what suggestions you'd have for me. I am increasingly thankful that God's priority is with individual hearts, not political influence.
