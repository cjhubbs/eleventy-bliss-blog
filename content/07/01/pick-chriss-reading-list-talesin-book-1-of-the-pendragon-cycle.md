On to a book recommended by Nate Downey: _[Taliesin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=038070613X%26tag=caedmonscalln-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/038070613X%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")_ by Stephen Lawhead, which is book one of five books in Lawhead's _Pendragon Cycle_.

I read _Taliesin_ over Christmas break. My first surprise was when I looked at the publisher's page in the front of the book and saw it was published by CrossWay Books, which is a Christian publishing house. "UhOh", I thought... "I hope this isn't going to be some silly Christian novel trying to masquerade as fantasy." But I had faith in Nate's selection, so I read on. And I was not let down.

_The Pendragon Cycle_ deals with the Arthurian legend, trying to flesh out the story and put faces on the people. _Taliesin_ is a great deal of back story; it follows the lives of a young lord in England and a princess of Atlantis who end up marrying; they have a child named Merlin who ends up being, well, _that_ Merlin. Along the way there is a typical amount of fantasy-type plot: we see Atlantis' destruction, intrigue, rivalry, and warfare between the various clans, and the introduction of some early Christian missionaries.

It was that last bit that started to get me worried. The missionaries are introduced about two-thirds of the way through the book, and while on one hand I know that the Arthurian legend needs to have a Christian component (he does seek the Holy Grail, after all), I was worried that it might turn from a decent novel into an evangelistic enterprise quicker than you can say Pendragon. But the author handles it well; he allows the characters to become Christians and wrestle with Christian ideas while avoiding the trap of having them give long speeches about how everyone should come to Jesus and the like.

I really enjoyed _Taliesin_ - thanks, Nate! I will now have to reserve book two from the library when I get a chance.
