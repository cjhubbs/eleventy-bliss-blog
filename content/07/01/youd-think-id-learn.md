I stopped at the library yesterday afternoon to pick up a book I had reserved. (_Velvet Elvis_ by Rob Bell, yes, Heather, I'm finally getting around to reading it.) And of course, even with my book backlog, I couldn't stop with just that one book - I had to pick up two more while I was at it. My book pile next to my bed has gotten large. Very large. From memory, here's what's sitting there waiting to be read:

- _This is Your Brain on Music_ - Daniel Levitin - a fascinating book about how our brains deal with and remember music. I'm about 2/3 done with this one.
- _Submarines: A History_ - I forget the author. I started this one before I bought the previous title. It's in progress as well.
- _Traitor_ \- Stephen Coonts - I enjoy Coonts, this appears to be his latest.
- _Velvet Elvis_ - Rob Bell - Just picked it up. This will be the next one I start.
- _The Ragtime Club_? - some random novel I picked up yesterday, deals with Scott Joplin and the ragtime music scene. Looks mildly interesting.
- _Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln_ - Doris Kearns Goodwin - my mom recommended this one. Should be interesting.
- _The Republic_ - Plato - picked this one up with a Christmas gift card.
- _The Everlasting Man_ - G. K. Chesterton - This one is in progress as well - good stuff, but slow going.
- _Beyond All Earthly Powers_ - David Wells - a freebie for attending the Desiring God 2006 conference.
- _Lectures to my Students_ - Spurgeon - Bought at the DG2006 conference, read the first few chapters, it's still sitting there.
- _Looking Unto Jesus_ - Isaac Ambrose - my dad gave me this one a couple of years ago - I have started on it several times and never finished. Slow going, but good stuff.

There may be a few others, that's just all I can think of for now. If you haven't seen it already, I'm keeping [a list of all the books I finish this year](http://thehubbs.net/chris/books-ive-read-in-2007/). The link is on my sidebar, too.

\[Checked tonight when I got home - found I'd missed a couple: _What I Saw At The Revolution_ by Peggy Noonan and _Case Closed_ by Gerald Posner. I guess I've got even \*more\* reading to do. :sigh:
