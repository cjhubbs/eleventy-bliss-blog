Last night I used a jigsaw to cut two small notches, pulled the garage door opener up about another inch, reconnected everything, and it worked! So, 9 days, some very cold fingers, and [one broken thumb](/07/02/i-fought-the-door-and-the-door-won/) later, we have a functional garage door and can park the vehicles in the garage again.

This opener has three working remotes, which means one for each car and one for the house... no more cold, late-night, barefoot trips outside when we forget to shut the garage door! The only thing still not working is our van, which is supposedly equipped with the HomeStar system, and thus should be able to be programmed to open the garage door from a button on the overhead panel. So far, no luck. But even if I don't get that figured out, I can live with it. :-) It feels good to finally get that project finished.
