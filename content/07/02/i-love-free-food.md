It's true, I love free food.  A little too much sometimes.  I've had a plethora of free food this week.  Yesterday my team lead took us out to Biaggi's for lunch.  Then today my boss took us out to Ruby Tuesday for lunch.  I had the smokehouse burger, which has BBQ sauce and fried onions on it...  soooo good!  Now tonight our project is having a celebratory supper and drinks at Carlos O'Kelly's Mexican Restaurant.

I'm sure this can't be good for me.  In addition, the time I've spent eating out at lunch is time that normally I'd have spent at the gym instead.  So it's a double whammy: no exercise, too much food.

Next week I've gotta get back in the workout groove.  And try to keep it up when I travel the following week.
