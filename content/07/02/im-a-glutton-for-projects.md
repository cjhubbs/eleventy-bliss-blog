It seems like I always need a project of some sort to work on... so today I assigned myself another one. :-) After checking out Geof's fantastic update to [derekwebb.net](http://derekwebb.net), I checked and realized that [andrewosenga.net](http://andrewosenga.net) was available and hey, AO needs a good fan website.

So I snagged the domain name and I figure that I've got a business trip coming up where I'll have a bunch of time to do design, when I'm not out walking around Washington.
