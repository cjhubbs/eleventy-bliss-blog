Yesterday morning  we got a guy out to fix the garage door, so it now goes up and down like it should.  So last night I spent most of the evening trying to get the garage door opener installed.  Close, but no banana.  The rail on this opener is a bit taller than the previous one, and with the limited space between the garage door and the rafters in the garage, it's just too tight.  So my next step will have to be to use a jigsaw and cut a small (1/2" max) notch in the right spot in a couple of rafters.  Slowly but slowly, it's coming together.
