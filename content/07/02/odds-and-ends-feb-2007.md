I'm sure I've used that title before, but oh well. Seems like this place has been filled up with book reviews lately and not much else. Let's see, what else should I talk about? The cold? The temperature display on my PC at the moment says it's -9 degrees F outside. We're supposed to get a heat wave by the weekend, though - up into the 20's!

Life has pretty much settled down for now after the craziness of December and early January. One bit of fun is that we're having our church talent show down at Central Park Presbyterian Church (a facility we're talking about buying), and they have a nice pipe organ... so I got a request for some organ music. I've been working on Bach's famous _Tocatta & Fugue in D Minor_ for a couple of weeks now and have the keyboard parts learned pretty well... but I'm worried that the pedal parts will be my undoing. I'm headed over to the church tomorrow night to practice on the organ for a while. We'll see how it goes. If it's a total flop I'll just pull out some piano fugues and play 'em on the organ... good enough. But still... a PIPE ORGAN! Too much fun.
