As I updated my 2007 reading list yesterday, I became convicted about how many novels of dubious quality I've read (23 books in 75 days!) and how short my time in the Scripture has been lately. As such, I am making this resolution: for the next month (March 20 - April 20), I am going to restrict my reading to just the Bible. I want to read it in broad pieces, to try to pick up the sweep of the grand story of God's work.

I don't know how far I'll get in just a month, but I have a feeling it'll be a ways. So don't expect any reading page updates for a while. I don't think it'll be a great loss. :-)
