On my way home from work every day I pass a billboard that frustrates me. It's a simple message, white text on a black background. It's designed to look like a written note. The words:

> One nation under Me.
> 
> \--God

Undoubtedly this billboard was purchased by some well-meaning evangelical wanting to make a point about their beliefs that American was a Christian country, should continue to be a Christian country, etc, and remind us about the battle over the Pledge of Allegiance. I don't want to debate those points at all. Not that I necessarily agree with them exactly, but there are people in my congregation that would wholeheartedly agree with them, and I don't have time to write a full, thoughtful response to the ideas; nor do I want to offend them by giving a less than thoughtful answer. So let's leave that particular question alone.

These signs with 'messages from God' aren't something new - they've been a staple on billboards for the past several years, and on church signs for many years before that. Even the Life Magazine that came in today's newspaper had a collection of photos of church signs, including the ever-popular "let's meet at my house today before the game -- God" sign. (As an interesting aside, one church is now using a reverse strategy: [messages from Satan](http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2007/03/satan_hates_life.html).) In general, my attitude is iffy-but-OK with this type of message. Many times they just come across as cheesy (such as the church sign example above), but sometimes they can manage to be thought-provoking instead.

But this particular billboard really bothers me. Why? Because, first of all, it's not something God ever said. The "One nation, under God" phrase was added to our Pledge of Allegiance by Congress, back in the fifties. I guess it's become all too common today to put our words in God's mouth, but this seems pretty flagrant. Second, I'm not sure it's a message that God would endorse. I don't think God is worried too much about America becoming a "Christian nation" again. God is much more concerned with people, individuals, coming to Him and being a part of His kingdom. God's focus is the Church, not the political system or national structure.

My call is that we set our priorities by His priorities. Sure, that's easy to say, harder to work out. But there are some places where it can be pretty clear. Let's put our focus on forwarding Christ's kingdom, not in trying to restore a "Christian nation". If God wills, our country will come around. If not, well, God knows what He's doing. My guess it you're not going to find out about it, though, from a billboard.
