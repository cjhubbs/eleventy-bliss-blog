Poor Laura is so confused; this week is really birthday overload.  First we celebrated Addison's and my birthdays over the weekend with the whole family.  Then she gets told that yesterday is actually Addison's birthday.  Then today is my birthday.  At least tomorrow we can assure her that it isn't anybody's birthday.  :-)

Happy birthday to my little girl Addison Grace, who turned 1 year old yesterday.

I don't have any big comments on turning 30 - so far it just seems like another day to me.   I'll keep you posted.
