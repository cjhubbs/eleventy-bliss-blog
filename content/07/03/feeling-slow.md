I'm feeling slow today.  Partially, it's that I've managed to catch the cold that bothered Becky and the girls most of last week.  Partially, I think it's just the lack of sleep catching up with me - too many late nights and early mornings.  Partially, I've eaten too much birthday cake in the past week and haven't been to the gym often enough.   The resulting combination leaves me dragging.  :-(

On the positive side, it's nearly lunchtime!
