Step 1: Put your ipod on random. Step 2: Post the first line from the first 25 songs that play, no matter how embarassing. Step 3: Strike out the songs when someone guesses correctly.

Now, y'all got lucky here and got some easy ones. Bonus points to the person who guesses the artist for #1.

15. Once upon a time you dressed so fine
