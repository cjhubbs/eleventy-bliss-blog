...home again, home again, jiggety jig.

I always seem to forget the beginning of that rhyme, but I quote the end of it often enough.  I made it home last night from Washington (via Minneapolis) thanks to the skill of the Northwest Airlines pilots who drove our DC-9 through snow and 30 knot landing winds to get us to Cedar Rapids.  Still, it was a late night - got home about 12:30, and many thanks go out to Daniel Garner for graciously agreeing to pick me up at the airport so Becky could stay home with the girls.

When I get a chance to stop and think, I'm sure there are a couple more blog posts to be written about this trip, but for now I'm just glad to be home.
