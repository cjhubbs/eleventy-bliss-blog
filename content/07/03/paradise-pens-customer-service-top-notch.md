Just thought I'd follow up on [my post from last week](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2007/03/08/in-praise-of-good-customer-service/) about my experience with [Paradise Pens](http://paradisepen.com).

On Tuesday, five days (and only three business days) after making that phone call, I received, via UPS, a replacement fountain pen. It had obviously been opened and tested out to ensure that it was in good shape before sending it to me. Then I noticed the mailing label. While I had bought my original pen in Arlington, VA, they shipped the replacement from their store in Minneapolis at the Mall of America, presumably since it was the closest store to me in Iowa. It impressed me that they would make that extra effort.

Two days later in a separate package I received another envelope with a pre-paid UPS shipping label and a nice handwritten note from the manager of the Arlington store. All I had to do was drop the old pen in the box, apply the label, and drop it off at a local UPS store.

I've been using my pen all week and have really been enjoying it. I'm thinking if I ever get another one, I'll be wanting a fine nib instead of the medium one that this pen has; I like to write in a fairly small script and it's hard to do with the wider nib. But overall, I am very, very impressed with the customer service I received. I will definitely be visiting Paradise Pens again when I go back to DC in May.
