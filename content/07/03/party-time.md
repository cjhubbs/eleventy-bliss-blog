This weekend my parents and brothers will all be coming to visit. (My sister is in Panama doing missions stuff.) The occasion: the first of what will, God willing, be a long lifetime of birthday convergences: Addison has her first birthday on the 13th, and then I celebrate the big three-oh on the 14th. I'm sure we'll eat far too much food, stay up too late talking, tell lots of bad jokes, and play innumerable rounds of Dutch Blitz or some other equally competitive game.

Good times will be had by all. Best wishes to everyone who reads this and their weekends!
