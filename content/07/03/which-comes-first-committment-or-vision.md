In the midst of a church meeting last night discussing our church's future plans, a question came up that I imagine we will be wrestling with in future weeks.  I'm not entirely sure what I think the answer is yet, so I'll post it here to see if any of you have comments.

The question goes something like this: in the context of a church, which comes first?  Do people first have to get "the vision", and then will respond with committment?  Or rather, do people first need to be committed to serve, and then begin to see the vision of the church ministry?

Still chewing on this one...
