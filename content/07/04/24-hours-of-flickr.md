Geof [pointed this out](http://ijsm.org/archives/2007/04/26/24-hours-of-flickr/) and it sounds like a lot of fun. Flickr, the fantastic photo-sharing website, is sponsoring a ["24 hours of Flickr"](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2007/04/its_coming_24_h.html) event for May 5th. I think it'd be a good opportunity to give the new camera some more use and just take a bunch of pictures. Sounds like [Rae](http://ijsm.org/archives/2007/04/26/24-hours-of-flickr/#comment-235447) and [Jeff](http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2007/04/27/24-hours-of-flickr/) are going to jump in, too - it'll be fun to compare days!
