A [month ago today I resolved](/07/03/a-resolution/) I was going to put down my endless string of library books and spend a month just reading the Bible. Today is the end of that month.

April 20 I started reading in Genesis 1 and decided I'd just read through, getting a feel for the breadth of the story. A month later I'm through the book of Ezra, maybe a third of the way through the whole Book if you just look at how many pages I've covered. It's been good reading and good reminder.

There have been some times I've really missed having some other good book to read - most notably the hours I was on an airplane traveling to Salt Lake City and back, and occasionally in the evenings when something less-than-memorable is on TV and I'm in the habit of reading while the TV's on.

I think it was a worthwhile exercise, though. It made me more convinced that I need to focus on reading quality books, things that will be worth my time, and avoid just rushing through a long string of mediocre titles just to max out my reading list. (I know there's no way my list will be as long as Kari's - no sense in going crazy trying.)

I'm going to be done with work a little big early today. I'm going to suggest to Becky that we make an "overdue" stop at the library. :-)
