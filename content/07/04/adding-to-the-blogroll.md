It's been a while since I've updated the links on my blogroll to the right. I realized today that I'm way behind in adding Rae Whitlock's blog to my list of links. I met Rae in person for the first time last fall, and he's one of those guys I am real proud to call a brother.

Rae recently resurrected his blog and I am happy to add a link to it today. Go check out [raewhitlock.com](http://raewhitlock.com) when you get a chance. I enjoy it, maybe you will too.
