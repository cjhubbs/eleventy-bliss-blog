Got home last night from a quick business trip to Salt Lake City. I haven't been to SLC since a family trip many years ago. It's a beautiful place, and the weather was fresh and warming to spring. My co-worker and I spent 2 days in meetings before flying home. All in all, a good, worthwhile trip, uneventful flights, not bad at all. It was sure good to be home and see Becky and the girls again.

Tomorrow morning we'll be heading out for Wisconsin to see my folks over Easter weekend. It will be good to see them again - it's only been a few weeks, I guess, but still... the girls change so much in just a few weeks, I'm sure they'll be amazed.

That's the basic update from the home front. I'm debating pre-buying (and then downloading) the new Derek Webb album ([on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000OHZJJG/) or check it out at [www.theringingbell.com](http://www.theringingbell.com)) so I can take it along on our drive tomorrow. I'm listening to it streaming right now and it sounds really good. I'm also shopping around for a Digital SLR camera. At the moment I have my eye on a [Nikon D70s](http://www.beachcamera.com/shop/product.aspx?sku=NKD70S1870). I'm hoping in the next few weeks I'll be able to put in the order.

Well, enough for now.
