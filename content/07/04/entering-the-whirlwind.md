I feel like I've been in it for a few days already, but I know there's still more to come this week.

Friday afternoon I drove four hours to Omaha to see Andy Osenga in concert at a little place called [The Foundry](http://www.omahafoundry.com). It was a great show, fun to see Andy again and visit. There was a 7:00 Saturday morning elder meeting scheduled at church, so I had to turn around and head back home right after the show. What I _did_ learn from that experience was that the right combination of diet pop, sweet tea, Red Bull, and candy will keep me wide awake on a four-hour drive in the middle of the night. Good to know.

Saturday was the aforementioned meeting and then time at home to catch up a bit - cleaning, spending time with the family, watching some of the Final Four on TV. Also watched a pretty cool SciFi channel miniseries that I'd TiVo'd back in December called _The Lost Room_. Becky even enjoyed it. Good stuff.

Sunday morning I led music for both services, then we had an afternoon elder meeting, then the church's annual meeting in the evening. Thank the Lord most of that stuff is done with for now.

Now it's Monday morning, and I'll be at work for a few hours before heading home, eating lunch with the family, and then flying out to Salt Lake City for a quick trip for work. I'll be back home on Wednesday night.

Friday morning I get off work (Good Friday) and so we are taking the girls up to my folks' place for the weekend. The girls will have fun seeing Grandma and Grandpa again. By the time I get back home on Sunday night, well, I'll be ready to be home for a while. :-)

Welcome to the Whirlwind. It's a wild ride.
