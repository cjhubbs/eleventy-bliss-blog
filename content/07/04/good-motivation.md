I just filled out the entry forms for two 5K races in upcoming months: the [Marion Arts Festival 5K](http://www.pigmantri.com/artrun.html) (May 19) and the [Hog Wild Days Squeal'n'Run 5K](http://www.hiawatha-iowa.com/Recreation/hog_wild/hogwild.htm) (June 16). The latter, happily, starts and ends at Gutheridge Park, only 4 blocks or so from my house. While I don't expect to be competitive in either of the races, they provide some good motivation for me to keep training. I've been getting lazy these last few weeks. Can't let that continue!
