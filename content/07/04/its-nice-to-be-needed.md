I got a phone call late Saturday afternoon - apparently Dave, who was scheduled to lead music at church Sunday,  had a family emergency of some sort.  (Don't know any more than that, will have to keep them in prayer.)  So, as a last-minute thing, I led music at both services Sunday morning.

It went well, actually; I showed up about an hour early for the first service, planned some music, set up the slides for the overhead, and wrote out a new order of service to make sure everyone was on the same page.  It was good to get up there and bang on the ivories again.

The good people of Noelridge will get a two-in-a-row from Chris now; I'm already scheduled to lead this upcoming Sunday.  I think I'll plan it a little further in advance this time.  :-)
