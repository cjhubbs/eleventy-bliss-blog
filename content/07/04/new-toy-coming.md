Thanks to some unexpected cash influx, I was able to purchase this earlier this week:

![Nikon D70s](/images/2007/nikon-d70s-review-1.jpeg)

It's a Nikon D70s, a quite nice Digital SLR camera. Only 6 megapixels, but that should be plenty for me.

Fedex promises it'll be delivered tomorrow... can't wait. Looking forward to posting more pictures here... you can be bet I'll be taking a lot of pictures. :-)
