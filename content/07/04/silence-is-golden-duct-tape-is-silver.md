[![Silence is Golden](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/chrislow-735113.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/chrislow-735113.jpg "Silence is Golden")

The picture here is the only one I could find online that illustrated the tshirt I was thinking of for that quote. Fun, huh? :-)

It's been pretty quiet here on the ol' blog lately. (I know, it's a blog cliche - when you haven't written for a while, you break the silence by writing about the fact that you haven't written for a while... so sue me.) If you ignore the picture posts and all the linky stuff, I haven't written anything substantive in a while. Sorry.

It's not that I haven't been thinking or wanting to write, but a bunch of issues here locally have been taking up my mental energy, and they're not things I can write about here.

I'm supposed to write a short piece for the church newsletter by tomorrow; if I get it done and it's not totally awful I'll post it here - maybe it'll be worthwhile.

If you want something more interesting to read, go visit one of the blogs I have linked on my sidebar. You'll find some good stuff there. I read 'em all, too.
