Life has been crazy this week, keeping me from writing much in the way of a thoughtful post about anything. I will inadequately attempt to make up for this by providing some random bullets from my week.

- Orlando, here we come. My employer has decided to send me to a "technology forum" put on by a microprocessor company. It appears to me that "technology forum" is code words for "wine and dine the engineers so they'll buy our product." It's the last week in June, and we're planning that Becky will come along on the trip. She's just slightly excited.
- Sermon preparation. I will be in the pulpit Sunday at [Noelridge](http://www.noelridge.org). (I'll try to remember to post audio next week for the 0.03% of you that are interested.) Secret sneak preview for my few NPC readers: Jethro. You can figure it out from there. Actually, you probably can't. So you have to come and listen on Sunday. Ha!
- Jabber servers, MySQL, PHP. Set up a [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org) server on a machine here at work for a project this week. Used [Wildfire](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp), it went super-easy. Then learned enough PHP to generate web pages that display a given days' chat logs by pulling them out of the database. Good times.
- Arcade Fire. Been listening to their latest album _Neon Bible_ this morning and I like it.
- "Get the picture." With some unexpected funds coming in I am hoping to buy a digital SLR camera. I have my eye on a [Nikon D70s](http://www.beachcamera.com/shop/product.aspx?sku=NKD70S1870), hoping to be able to order it next week.
