This morning I had the privilege to preach at the Noelridge Sunday morning services. My text was Exodus 18, entitled "A Father-In-Law's Lesson" - based on the lesson that Jethro had for Moses. I think it went pretty well, I was excited to have the chance to preach again. For those of you interested, you can [download the sermon (mp3, 7.1 MB)](http://noelridge.org/dl.aspx?file=20070415.mp3) or [stream it here](http://www.noelridge.org/downloads/20070415.m3u).

Edit: It sounds like I screwed up the audio; instead of converting it to mono, I managed to just delete one of the tracks. I also need to amplify the whole thing a bit. Maybe tonight. Still, if you can stand just listening to it in one ear, go for it.

I uploaded the new audio just now - converted it to full mono and amplified it so that it is about the right volume. Gotta love Audacity.
