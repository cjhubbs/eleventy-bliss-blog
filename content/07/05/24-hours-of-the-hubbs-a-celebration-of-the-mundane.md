When I decided to do 24 hours of Flickr, I wasn't really sure what my Saturday would entail. Nonetheless, I gave it a go. As Saturdays go, it was fairly basic. We went to some neighborhood garage sales, cleaned out the garage, went shopping, and watched a movie. So while some of the pictures are cute, none of them are particularly artsy or profound. Oh well.

Here are a few samples of the pictures; you're welcome to visit [the whole set on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157600181071573/).
