In the past year I have become a fan of N. T. Wright. Rev. Wright is the Bishop of Durham in the Church of England. He is the author of a number of books, but the one that got me started was [Simply Christian: Why Christianity Makes Sense](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0060507152%26tag=caedmonscalln-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0060507152%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02). While not being a replacement for C. S. Lewis' _Mere Christianity_, as some have tried to make it, _Simply Christian_ is a makes a good argument for the sense of Christianity. From there I read Wright's [What Saint Paul Really Said](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0802844456%26tag=caedmonscalln-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0802844456%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02), and greatly enjoyed it as well. While I don't necessarily agree with all of Wright's doctrine, I have found his writing to be clear and accessible.

Naturally once I found I liked his writings, I downloaded whatever sermon audio I could find. That had initially come from here and there, a sermon at a time. However, I found a site this morning that is the jackpot: [ntwrightpage.com](http://ntwrightpage.com/). Billed as "an unofficial website dedicated to the Bishop of Durham", this page links to seemingly every known article and sermon recording of Wright's that's available on the web; some 60+ articles and 40+ lectures/sermons are available. Amazing.

I went download-happy this morning and pulled down about 150 MB of lectures. These will be a happy addition to my iPod as I travel next week. :-)
