Normally when I read a good column I'm just gonna hit the [Gordita](http://www.memerocket.com/2006/11/05/gordita-delicious-tagging-for-google-reader/) button and post it to [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/hubbsc/), which means it'd show up here tonight in the links area. But [today's column by Thomas Sowell on NRO](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmU0NGQ0ZTQzZTU4Zjk4MjdjZWMzYTM4Nzk2MzQ0MGI=) is worth a post of its own. Sowell gives us a column of "random thoughts", including some very quote-worthy thoughts. Just a few:

> A reader wrote: “Have you ever noticed that opinion polls ask the opinions of people who have no expertise in the subject on which they are being polled and publish these opinions as if they were gospel truth instead of group ignorance?”

> Some of the biggest cases of mistaken identity are among intellectuals who have trouble remembering that they are not God.

> Too many people in positions of responsibility act as if these are just positions of opportunity — for themselves. The ones who simply steal money probably do less harm than teachers who propagandize their students, media who slant the news, or politicians who sell out their country’s interests in order to get reelected.

You should probably go read the whole thing.
