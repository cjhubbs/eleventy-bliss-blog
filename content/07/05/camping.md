When I was a kid, we went camping as a family all the time. I think some of my siblings enjoyed the out-of-doors more than I did, but still, it was a good time for the whole family and a cost-effective way to go on vacation. :-) After we got married, Becky and I went camping a few times; most notably we were in Colorado camping when 9/11 happened... but that's a different story.

Fast-forward to today. Well, to tomorrow. Tomorrow morning we will pack the van and head out to Devil's Lake State Park in Wisconsin for two nights of camping with my family. Andrew's girlfriend Heather (hi, Heather, do you still read this thing?) is visiting for the next 10 days, so Andrew has organized pretty much the whole camping trip. ("Remember to bring your softball equipment" x 100 or so. :-) ) I'm hoping the girls will enjoy it; they'll certainly enjoy seeing all the uncles and grandparents again. How well they sleep in a tent will be an entirely different story.

I'll be sure to take a bunch of pictures and post them here once we get back. This weekend starts what will be a whirlwind month and a half for us; this camping trip, I have a trip to DC, Becky's folks visit for 2 weeks, I run a couple of 5ks, and then we go to Orlando for the better part of a week while the girls stay with their grandparents. It'll be fun, but it'll also be a relief to have it slow down in July.

(Yikes! Did I really just say July?)
