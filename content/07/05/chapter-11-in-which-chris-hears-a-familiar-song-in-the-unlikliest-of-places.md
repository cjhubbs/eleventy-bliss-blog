Last night was a date night for Becky and me. We dropped the girls off with some friends for a couple of hours and headed to Casa Las Glorias for the Mexican food I'd been craving all week. Darn tasty stuff. (What's this white stuff on my nachos? (Sorry, square peg joke. Carry on.)) Unexpectedly, they had a musician strolling the aisles at the restaurant, singing and playing the guitar. He was singing what I'd consider to be typical Mexican restaurant music, and doing a good job of it.

He finished another song in Spanish, thanked the patron at the table next to ours for a tip, and then started on another guitar strum. This one sounded vaguely familiar. I was trying to place it, and then he started singing, and I was dumbfounded. "Well it looks like five thousand miles broke the camel's back... but it's not as though I had a plan to win you back..." At this point Becky looked at me quizzically, because she recognized the song, too. No way. NO. WAY. The strolling guitarist in Casa Las Glorias is playing a Caedmon's Call song?!? What the heck!

The young man continued strolling and singing while we finished our dinner. He had an assortment of Mexican songs, but he was also verging into pop music territory with some John Mayer, Dave Matthews, and the like. When we finished dinner I gave him a tip and we discussed Caedmon's for a couple minutes. He was surprised to find another fan in the restaurant. He admitted that the latest album he owns is _Back Home_, and I encouraged him to get ahold of _Share The Well_ and that they have a new album coming out in August. Then we parted ways; he kept singing, we headed off to continue our evening out.

I have a feeling it'll be many days before I hear a Caedmon's Call song sung in a restaurant again.
