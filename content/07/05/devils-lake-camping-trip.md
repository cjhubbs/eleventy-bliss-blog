Yes, [as promised](/07/05/camping/), we went camping last weekend up at [Devil's Lake State Park](http://www.devilslakewisconsin.com/) in Wisconsin. My brother Andrew pretty much organized the whole thing; his girlfriend Heather is visiting and it was good to get to see everybody. Some thoughts from the weekend:

- Devil's Lake is a beautiful park. Dave, if you read this, yeah, it's worth going for a day trip or an overnight. Lots of nice hiking, the water is beautiful and crystal-clear.
- What the park service considers "paved, flat, and level" in a hiking trail isn't so much what I'd consider "paved, flat, and level". It scares me a little bit what one of their "difficult" trails would look like. :-)
- Tent camping when it gets down to 40F at night is kinda chilly.
- Tent camping when it rains overnight is more of a pain.

Now, mind you, I don't want to sound whiny. It was a fun weekend, a good time was had by all. Many [pictures are available](http://flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157600212050922/) on my Flickr site, and I'll append a few of them here. We had a fun time just crashing around the campfire, playing on the beach, and hiking. We enjoyed watching the rain whilst sitting indoors at McDonald's eating breakfast on Sunday. :-)

Overall, it was a good weekend, but good to be back home, too.
