Part of the goofiness with my job is that by the time we get these announcements, I've been done with the software for months. Still, it's fun to know that they're flying these things now.

From [AvWeb](http://www.avweb.com/eletter/archives/bizav/858-full.html#195107):

> FIRST CITATION ENCORE+ DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER  
> <br/>
> Cessna Aircraft announced Tuesday that it delivered the first Citation Encore+ to an undisclosed customer. The latest Citation V derivative is powered by two FADEC-equipped, 3,400-pound-thrust Pratt & Whitney Canada PW535B engines that offer "high durability and reliability," and "surpasses the most stringent environmental standards for emissions, set by the International Civil Aviation Organization."

> Besides the upgraded powerplants, the $8.273 million Encore+ has an increased gross weight that allows for a full-fuel payload of 1,170 pounds, 340 pounds more than the original Encore. According to Cessna, this weight increase also extends the airplane's range with higher passenger loads. In the flight deck, the Encore+ sports a Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 integrated avionics suite, which marks a significant change from its predecessor's Honeywell Primus 1000 avionics.
