Having been in DC since Monday night, I'm good and ready to be heading home.  Our meetings have been useful but are winding down, and my flight leaves Washington Reagan at 2:30.  I'll head out of here, find some lunch, and make my way down to the airport.   I heard a rumor that our next quarterly meeting might be in Seattle instead of DC, which would be nice for an August meeting.  If not, I've got a couple hotels scoped out that would be nice to stay at when we meet back here in August.

It will be good to get home.
