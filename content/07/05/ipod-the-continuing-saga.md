Took my iPod with the bad battery and service plan back to Best Buy today.  They have to send it in for service, and gave me the option of either having my iPod serviced in about 2 weeks, or in the quick replacement plan where they send me a similar iPod, refurbished, right away - i.e. 3 - 5 business days.  I opted for the latter option - the quicker the better, and I'm not tied to my particular piece of hardware - I just want something that works.

I'm hoping it ends up being more like 3 business days instead of 5, but then, I'm just awfully impatient sometimes.  We'll see how it goes.
