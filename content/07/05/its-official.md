I've known about this for a while now, but it's finally official and fair to announce. [Caedmon's Call](http://caedmonscall.com) announced yesterday that Derek Webb, a former member of the group, and since then an excellent solo artist, will be joining the group on their new album, _Overdressed_ (due in August) and will be touring with them on the Overdressed tour.

I never made it to hear Caedmon's before Derek left the band; I've heard both of them separately, though. I can't wait to hear them all on stage together.
