I'm headed out of town today; assuming that Northwest Airlines does their thing, I will be in Washington, DC by mid-evening. I'll be attending two and a half days of [RTCA](http://www.rtca.org) committee meetings. Such fun! I should be home on Thursday night.

Happily, my in-laws are arriving this afternoon to visit. They will be good company for Becky and the girls while I'm gone, and since they're staying for two weeks, I'll get to see them too when I get home.
