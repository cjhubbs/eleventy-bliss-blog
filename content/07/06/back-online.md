So just as I was about to get _really_ frustrated with Qwest, UPS showed up with their "welcome letter" and login details about 5 PM Tuesday. It was easy enough to set up the DSL modem; they've actually streamlined their install process quite a bit in the last couple of years. Good deal.

Then I went to hook up my existing wireless router to it. No luck. Hooked it back up hardware, did some Googling, and found out that yeah, it's potentially possible, but not simple, to get my D-Link router to work with their ActionTec DSL modem. :-( Rather than fight with it for hours that I don't have, I went back to Best Buy, returned the DSL modem, and bought the DSL modem that is wireless-equipped. So, I'm out $50, but I can probably sell the D-Link to recoup part of that cost.

Back home with the right piece of hardware, it took mere minutes to have my wireless network back up and running. I'll have to relocate the DSL modem this weekend; I really want it in the basement by the PC down there, but I can't find the phone line. I stowed it up somewhere during the cleanup effort after the [Great New Year's Eve Flood of Aught-Six](/07/01/the-great-new-years-eve-flood-of-aught-six/), and now it doesn't want to be found. Still, it's good to be back online. I'm also happy with the DSL speed - cable sure wasn't supporting 100 Kbps uploads!
