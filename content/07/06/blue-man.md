Last night Becky and I went to see [Blue Man Group](http://blueman.com/) over at Universal Orlando. BMG is one of those acts that's very hard to describe to folks who haven't heard of them before. "Well, it's three guys. And they're all blue. And they do stuff with drums... and paint..." You see? That makes no sense at all, does it?

So last night we had tickets that put us in row 3, the "poncho" area. That's right, there are plastic ponchos on each seat and yeah, you ought to wear them. It truly is the "spray zone". The show was a mix of loud music, sweet drumming, and humor. The Blue Men never say anything, but the show is narrated by an unseen voice. They did a few hilarious "skits", and they often pulled audience members up to participate. The one girl did so well that I have a hard time believing she wasn't a plant - no way a random person does so well in an improvisational scene. But still, it was quite enjoyable. We laughed a lot, went "wow" several times, and left the show bleary-eyed but pleased. Oh, and Dad, if you read this: you'd get a real kick out of the trombonish instrument they made out of PVC pipe. Pretty cool. Here's the picture as they're trying to assemble it:

For those really curious about BMG, there's a pretty decent review written up [here](http://www.ballet-dance.com/200507/articles/BlueManGroup20050611.html).
