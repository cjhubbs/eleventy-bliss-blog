- Still no iPod. I'm hoping for today, but I'm just about tired of hoping.
- Did an insurance review with our agent yesterday. It's always a bleak affair; her job is to suggest all the things that might go wrong that we should be covered for. Ugh.
- On the upside, Laura went to sleep at 7:30 last night. Earliest in a week.
- On the downside, she came into our room at 11 wanting to sleep in our bed, and pitched an hour-long fit when we made her sleep in her room.
- Ordered a [hard drive enclosure](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817145133) from [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com) yesterday to give me someplace to put a 160 GB hard drive I now have free. While my total storage space will still be paltry in comparison to, say, [Geof's](http://gfmorris.net) or [Mark's](http://virtualsmiley.net), it'll still be nice to have more space.
- I'm not leading music at church this week, but I still am teaching Sunday School. Still gotta prepare.
