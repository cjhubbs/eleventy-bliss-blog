That's right, free music. Download it, listen to it as much as you want. Then go make a donation to the cause.

What am I raving about? Well, [Andy Osenga](http://andrewosenga.com), being bored through the summer and needing a project, decided to record an EP based on ideas, phrases, photos, etc submitted by the readers of his blog. Back on May 23 [he put out the call](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2007/05/23/lets-make-some-music/) for ideas. He got a lot of them. He started writing songs. Then he came up with the idea of ["Webground VocalsÂ®"](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2007/06/01/webground-vocals/). Basically he allowed anyone who wanted to to record a background track and he included 35 of them on the album. (Yeah, that's my name you'll see near the end of the list. :-) ) Then he wrote and recorded the whole album in two weeks' time. (I should include that he let me [scoop the album title and cover art](http://andrewosenga.net/2007/06/11/letters-to-the-editor-volume-1/) about two hours early on [andrewosenga.net](http://www.andrewosenga.net).)

In addition to six very good songs, this **free** download includes an 18-page PDF "liner" that includes the lyrics, pictures that inspired the writing, pictures of the guitars Andy played on the album, and even a picture of that missing toe that inspired Andy Gullahorn's _Roast Beef_.

So here's what you want to do:

1. Head over to Andy's website and [download the album](http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/letters-to-the-editor-vol-1/).
2. Follow [Andy's Paypal link](http://www.andrewosenga.com/donate) and donate some funds. He has cute kids who need to eat.
3. Share this information with a couple hundred of your closest friends so they, too, can enjoy the musical goodness.

You will thank me.
