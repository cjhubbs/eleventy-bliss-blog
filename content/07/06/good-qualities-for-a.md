We were sitting in a conference room at work the other day and there was a large pad that someone had written on in a previous meeting. I don't know the context of the meeting or the notes on the pad, but what was written on the pad was this:

- Outgoing
- Energetic
- Sociable
- Responsible
- Respectful
- Flexible

We took a minute to be amused at it, and then one of my co-workers asked "so what word shall we add?"

We all thought about it a second, and another co-worker chimed in, "Inflatable?"

It was all downhill after that.
