After [BestBuy's impressive performance](/07/05/ipod-replacement-a-for-effort-d-for-results/) in getting me my first refurbished iPod, it has now been 12 days since I was promised my _next_ refurbished iPod, and I still don't have a replacement. I called the "Geek Squad" representative last Friday; he looked it up on the computer and assured me that my second service ticket had just closed out on Friday, so I should expect my iPod in "one to two" days, and if not, I should contact him.

I decided to be gracious and assume that he meant "one to two _business_ days", seeing as UPS doesn't typically deliver on Saturday or Sunday. So I waited. No UPS man yesterday. We already have a shopping trip planned to that side of town for this evening; if I don't get that iPod via UPS today I will be making a stop back at Best Buy tonight. I'll be curious to see what line they'll feed me - I certainly won't be happy with "wait a couple more days" - at a minimum I'll want a UPS tracking number or something to prove that my iPod has actually shipped. I'd really love it if they'd say "oops, something went wrong - can we just give you a merchandise credit for the original price of your iPod?", but I don't think there's much chance that'll happen. Oh, if it did, though? I'd put another $50 with it and get the 80GB iPod with video... Oh well, at least a guy can hope, right?
