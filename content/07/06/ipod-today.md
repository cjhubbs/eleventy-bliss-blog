Got an automated UPS phone call a few minutes ago saying that my iPod would be delivered today, and giving me the tracking number.  Good thing it went to voice mail - no way I would've been able to catch the tracking number with only one live listen.    UPS's tracking system agrees that the iPod is on the truck and out for delivery.  Now I'll just keep my fingers crossed that this one works.
