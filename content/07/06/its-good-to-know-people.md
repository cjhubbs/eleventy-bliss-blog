So the iPod case that [I mentioned yesterday](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2007/06/19/notes-on-a-tuesday-morning/) still hadn't shipped as of yesterday mid-morning. I was kinda disappointed - should it really take at least two days to send a single item? Ah well, so I went to my backup plan. Sent an email to [Tony](http://tklog.blogspot.com/) in Seattle who just happens to work at a Mac store. He was kind enough to offer to get me a case and ship it post-haste. By last night I had a UPS tracking number, and by tomorrow I should have the case, well in time for my trip to Florida next week. Woohoo! And thanks, Tony.

Last night late, then, I had a nice chat and recorded and interview with [Andy Osenga](http://andrewosenga.com/blog/). The interview has some audio issues and will require some post-production; I'll probably post it next week on [andrewosenga.net](http://andrewosenga.net). If you visit [ao.net](http://andrewosenga.net) now, though, you'll find [some info](http://andrewosenga.net/2007/06/20/writing-for-the-normals/) that might excite you if you are a fan of Andy's old band, The Normals. It was good to just chat with Andy and get an update. I'll have to do it again sometime soon.

So, yeah... it's good to know people. :-)
