...and it's rather boring.  Kinda sad, really.  Headed out and around to look for a piano to play, but can't seem to find one.  Don't think I've ever been to an upscale hotel before that didn't have a piano.  :-(   A tasty reception/dinner was provided by the conference, which was nice.  But what I'm really craving now is dessert of some sort.  However, the lounge/sushi bar in the hotel lobby doesn't serve dessert, and I just don't feel like going to sit in the restaurant for 30 minutes by myself.  So, I'm back in my room, watching baseball on ESPN.  I will certainly be glad to have Becky here tomorrow.
