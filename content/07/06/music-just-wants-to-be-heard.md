This is my first - but assuredly not my last - post about Caedmon's Call's upcoming album _Overdressed_. It will be available for pre-order in mid-June and will actually be available in August sometime. It's gonna be a fantastic album; the band announced last week that [Derek Webb will be back recording with the group](http://caedmonscall.net/2007/05/22/the-state-of-caedmons-call-may-2007/) for this album. Sweet!

What I want to address today, though, is the pre-order. Geof over at [caedmonscall.net](http://caedmonscall.net) has [launched an online petition](http://caedmonscall.net/2007/06/01/a-petition-for-the-pre-order/) of sorts to urge Caedmon's to provide an immediate digital download of their album upon pre-order, with the disk to follow up at the appropriate date. I am fully on board with this petition. The digital download worked awesomely with Derek Webb's solo album from earlier this year, and was again awesome when Jeremy Casella's _Recovery_ released last month.

So here's my request guys: find a way to make it happen. Let the music be heard! I'll be first in line for the pre-order.
