I'm getting ready to go sit in an all-day meeting with some customers that are in town. Not real exciting, but should be some good discussion. Mostly it's just looooong. At least food is provided. :-)

Ordered a case for my new iPod yesterday; it's the one that Tony recommended to me the other day. I expected that if I ordered early on Monday morning that I had a good shot at 3-5 day UPS shipping getting it here to me before I leave for Florida on Sunday. But as of this morning it still hasn't shipped. If I don't see some movement by noon today, I'm gonna talk to Tony and get one back-channel.

Went to Texas Roadhouse last night with the family and my mom and sister who are in town visiting. Didn't think I'd eaten too much last night, but this morning I can feel it. :-(

My Florida trip is coming up in less than a week. Orlando. We have tickets to see Blue Man Group, Becky's going to Sea World one day while I'm at my conference, and then we have a hotel on the beach for a couple nights before we come home. And the girls are staying with my folks. 5 more days...
