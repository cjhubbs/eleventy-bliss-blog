Made it with no serious travel glitches to Orlando about 7:30 pm local time. Gotta say this - that iPod with video capability is pretty great. I loaded Season One of Battlestar Galactica on it and made it through the first two episodes before my ears got sore from the headphones. You can bet I'll watch some more this week. Good stuff.

Got my rental car (a 2007 Mustang, pretty spiffy, though a little lacking in the headroom department) and found a restaurant to stop for some dinner before heading to the hotel. I guess hotel is really the wrong word - this thing is [a full-blown resort/convention center](http://www.grandelakes.com/jw_marriott/jw_marriott.cfm). Got a good room without a hitch, finished my week's worth of ironing, now I'm gonna finish a book and try to convince my body that it's really almost 11 pm instead of the 10 pm that it is back at home.

Tomorrow morning should be fairly slow, no meetings until 11 AM and then just afternoon sessions. Good times.
