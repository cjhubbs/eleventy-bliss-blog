Today is my last day in the office for a week or so, and I am definitely ready for the break. A synopsis of next week's events:

- **Sunday** \- flying out to Orlando.
- **Monday** \- [Freescale Technology Forum](http://www.freescale.com/ftf) begins.
- **Tuesday** \- Becky flies out to meet me. The girls are staying with my folks. (Thanks again, Mom and Dad!) Oh, and it's our ninth wedding anniversary.
- **Wednesday** \- more FTF during the day, and we're seeing Blue Man Group in the evening.
- **Thursday** \- FTF in the morning, then it's off to be beach bums.
- **Friday** \- whole lotta nothing. We have a hotel on the beach in Cocoa Beach. Should be nice.
- **Saturday** \- fly home in the afternoon. We have an overly-long layover in MSP, but such is life.

I shall come home a more rested person. It will be glorious. :-)
