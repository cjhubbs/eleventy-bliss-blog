Yesterday morning I was awake early so I went to the gym and hit the treadmill and the weight machines. I have been doing at least a bit of running, so the treadmill part wasn't bad; however, I haven't hit the weights in two or three months, so this morning I find myself pretty sore. It's a good kind of soreness, though - feels good to know that I actually did something.

I've pretty much been a slacker the last couple of months in going to the gym - time to get it cranked up again. Need to break the weight plateau I've been at for the last 4 or 5 months and get to losing some more pounds.
