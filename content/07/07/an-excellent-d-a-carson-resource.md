Andy Naselli has [an excellent list of links](http://anaselli.blogspot.com/2006/12/mp3s-of-d-carson.html) on his blog to many, many sermons available for download by D. A. Carson. I am a huge fan of Carson's and greatly enjoy listening to any of his talks that I can get my hands on. If you are similarly inclined, head over to Andy's site and start downloading. I just pulled down about 20 hours worth of audio. Good stuff.
