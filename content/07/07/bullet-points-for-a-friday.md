\[Once again, thanks to [dan](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/) for creating a good format to rip off.\]

- Laura turns three today! Happy birthday to my little sweetheart.
- New Orleans was pretty cool. I have a couple of blog posts floating around in my head, maybe I'll have some time this weekend to write them out.
- Never trust the airline when they say "oh, everything will be delayed, so you'll make your connection just fine."
- Driving home 4 hours from Chicago is long, but it beats staying there overnight.
- I almost forgot the going-away lunch in my honor scheduled for today. That would've been embarrassing.
- I have pretty much successfully moved into my new building/cube/department. Such fun.
