It appears that Google is doing some weird things with the links that it returns as search results. They look fine, and work fine, unless you want to right-click and copy link location on them. Strange.

For instance, while writing [my last post](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2007/07/05/what-day-is-it-again/), I wanted to look up the web address of [George Fox University](georgefox.edu), where my brother will be attending in the fall. Now, I had no idea what the address was. Fox.edu? GFU.edu? So, in my typical fashion, I opened another browser tab and did a quick Google search for George Fox University, and there is the first result: [georgefox.edu](http://georgefox.edu). So I right-click on the link and do a Copy Link Location, and go to paste that link into my blog post. However, when I post it, instead of getting "http://www.georgefox.edu", I get this:

[http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.george fox.edu%2F&ei=-eSMRpaoLYSQigG6yPHkDA&usg=AFQjCNGXhI7dMYm1-OiFkm BkO3khHsXcTw&sig2=U6CshRfTqybcaCchW7goHw](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.georgefox.edu%2F&ei=-eSMRpaoLYSQigG6yPHkDA&usg=AFQjCNGXhI7dMYm1-OiFkmBkO3khHsXcTw&sig2=U6CshRfTqybcaCchW7goHw)

_Note: I added spaces to that link so that the text will wrap around._

The weird thing is that if I hover over the link, Firefox's status bar reports the link as georgefox.edu. If I click on it, it takes me to georgefox.edu. But right-click Copy Link Location doesn't work. Grrr. So now I guess I'm going to have to start highlighting the link and doing a copy rather than just copying link location. What a pain.
