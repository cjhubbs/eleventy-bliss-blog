Becky and I arrived back home late in the evening Saturday.  Travel was uneventful, though we did have a long-ish layover (4.5 hours) in Minneapolis.  But hey, we got home, so no complaints.  It was a fun trip, quite relaxing and enjoyable.  I might post a few pictures to Flickr here when I get a chance, but it looks like they're mostly of the beach, and all the beach pictures tend to look the same before long.  There _are_ a couple night-time ones that came out pretty well - gotta love the new DSLR camera.  :-)

Now it's back to work, trying to clean out the ol' email inbox and figure out where I left stuff a week ago.
