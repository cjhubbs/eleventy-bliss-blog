Laura decided to come into our room about 4 o'clock this morning. She needed to go back and sleep in her own bed, so that was a struggle from about 4 to 5. I'm OK with that, hey, it's part of parenting, but I really want to know how my dream was gonna turn out.

I was one of a group of about four people, and we were heading into some medical office to interview someone that the authorities didn't want us to talk to. We had [Dr. Greg House](http://www.fox.com/house/) along to help out. And he was wearing one of those cool little chain mail headscarves that the knights wore in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. It could only get better from there... right?
