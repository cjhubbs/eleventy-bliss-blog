I have been looking back through my [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) archive and realized that I have a lot of stuff that I've starred that hasn't made it into a link dump. So here's your chance to catch up with online stuff that I've been enjoying!

[Tom Wright Talks](http://christianmind.blogspot.com/2007/07/tom-wright-talks.html). Links to two recent N. T. Wright lectures. I haven't actually listened to them yet, but I"ll get around to it.

[We Need the Gospel of Jesus in America.](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/message-to-tom-ascol-write-the-book) A plea from the Internet Monk. Always good stuff.

[A review of Voddie Baucham's _Family Driven Faith_.](http://rvanneste.blogspot.com/2007/07/family-driven-faith-review.html) I need to get a copy of this book.

iMonk again: [John Piper on why Christian Children should be confused](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/riffs-070207-john-piper-on-why-christian-children-should-be-confused).

[Summary of the "Confessions of a Pastor" talk](http://faithmaps.blogspot.com/2007/06/buzz-conference-friday-29-june-2007_29.html) from the Buzz Conference. Powerful stuff. Can't wait to hear the audio.

[You Need to Smile More.](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/you-need-to-smile-more) Or, reasons you might not need to. iMonk is one of my favorites.

[5 Reasons to have Family Worship.](http://www.joethorn.net/2007/06/14/5-reasons-to-have-family-worship/) Good reminders from Joe Thorn.
