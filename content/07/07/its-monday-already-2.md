Well, it was a busy weekend. The whole family showed up Friday night for one last get together before we head our separate ways this fall. The result was two days of playing cards, music, football, and making at least one obligatory Hubbs shopping trip to Walmart and Sam's Club. Aaron and Andrew also got haircuts... Andrew opting for the "I wanna look like Chris" haircut. I don't think he'll be maintaining his, though, so he should have hair again by the time he gets out out to Oregon.

Hit the gym this morning to run and do a little lifting, and yeah, it feels good to be sore again. I've been too much of a slacker the past couple of months. Gotta get back to it. The pounds don't lose themselves.
