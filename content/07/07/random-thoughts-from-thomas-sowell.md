[Thomas Sowell](http://author.nationalreview.com/?q=NDA3Mw==) has a good [column of random thoughts](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzVlZGQyMTcwNGQ4MjZkNzZhMDQ5MzVkZDdiMTM2OWI=) on [NRO](http://nationalreview.com) today.

A few good ones:

> Few things are more scary than the number of people who rely on talking points, instead of weighing serious issues in a serious way.

> In politics, there are few skills more richly rewarded than the ability to misstate issues in a way that will sound plausible and attractive.

> “A good catchword can obscure analysis for fifty years,” said Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. If so, then we may be hearing about “diversity,” “social justice” and “a living wage” for many years to come.

> Has anyone actually seen Rachael Ray measure out the ingredients she puts into her cooking, instead of using a pinch of this and a handful of that?

It's worth going to read [the whole thing](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzVlZGQyMTcwNGQ4MjZkNzZhMDQ5MzVkZDdiMTM2OWI=).
