This morning's visit to the bathroom here at work revealed that someone has again been leaving tracts on top of the toilet paper holder in the men's room stalls. Now, the efficacy of leaving tracts at random as opposed to other evangelistic techniques is a discussion for another blog post. But if you're going to leave a tract in the men's room, should [your first choice](http://www.gnpcb.org/product/663575724216) really have a pink rose and the words "You're Special" scripted on the front? \*sigh\*
