Well at least half of you who read this blog are already listening to this album, but I should still note that [Caedmon's Call](http://caedmonscall.com) released their 15th album yesterday, entitled _Overdressed_. It marks the return of Derek Webb as a contributor to Caedmon's, though whether he's actually considered a "member" of the band is fuzzy to me at the moment... the word "contributor" has been used more, I think.

Christianity Today gave this album 5 out of 5 stars yesterday, and it deserves them. Good solid music and songwriting all the way around. My man [Andy Osenga](http://andrewosenga.com) had a lot of influence on this album, and it's better off for it.

If you're interested in Overdressed, you can check out the info over on the [cc.net Song Vault](http://caedmonscall.net/song-vault/). Also, Bryan Allain has been doing some amazing liveblogging from the past few days and there are multiple videos, pictures, and inside info on songs available on [CaedmonsCall.net](http://caedmonscall.net). Go check it out. You can buy the album from their online store, too. I don't think it's available on iTunes yet, but it should be shortly.
