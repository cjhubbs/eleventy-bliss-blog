I'm sitting in the airport terminal at Cedar Rapids as the plane that is supposed to take me to Chicago is unloading its prior passengers.   From there it's off to Seattle.  If all goes well I should be there by 8 PM Seattle time.   I'm making this whole trip in order to be in person to make a twenty-minute presentation for a customer.   Such fun.  But it will allow some time tomorrow afternoon for some sightseeing in Seattle before heading back home early Tuesday morning.  I'm bringing the good camera; hopefully I'll have some good pictures to share once I get back.
