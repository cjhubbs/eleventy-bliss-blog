- [Why are we so scared of offending Muslims? - By Christopher Hitchens - Slate Magazine](http://www.slate.com/id/2171371/)
    
    "And the advocates and apologists of bigotry and censorship and suicide-assassination cannot be permitted to take shelter any longer under the umbrella of a pluralism that they openly seek to destroy." Good stuff from Hitchens.
