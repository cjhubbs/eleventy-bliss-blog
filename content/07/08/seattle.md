It's 8 AM in Seattle and this hotel restaurant is a pretty comfortable place to sit and write.  The in-room web access doesn't seem to be working, but the wi-fi in the lobby works just fine, so I can sit here and catch up on news and email whilst eating from the voluminous breakfast buffet.    It's fairly cloudy and cool this morning, but there's the threat of sunshine this afternoon, which would be nice.

I'm in town to support a meeting with a customer, but it still leaves me with most of the morning (the meeting doesn't start until 11) and a good portion of the afternoon (the meeting is over by 2 or so) free.  Couldn't manage to get a flight back home tonight on short notice, so I"ll be leaving on the early (5:45) flight in the morning.  Such fun.

This is my third trip to Seattle, and I really do enjoy the area.  So beautiful with the mountainous terrain, all the water, and I just adore the cool weather.  After the meetings today I'm planning on heading downtown to the Pike Place Market; for sure a tourist location, but it's been recommended by a couple friends so I guess I'll give it a go.  I'll be sure to post pics tomorrow when I get home.

Well, I've pretty much finished up here at the restaurant so I think I'll move to the lobby, find a plug-in for this laptop, and start working on some work stuff.  Should be at least moderately productive today.  :-)
