Becky and the girls stopped by my workplace for a few minutes this morning to drop off some lunch for me. As I sat in the van with them chatting for a few minutes, this conversation with Laura (3 years old) ensued:

**Me**: Yeah, Laura, I've got to go back to work for a few hours.... but then I'll come home.

**Laura**: And you'll go wee, wee, wee.... all the way back to my house?

_\[Becky chokes strangling laughter at this point.\]_

**Me:** Yep, then I'll come back to your house. Wee, wee, wee, like the little piggies? Are you saying that Daddy is a little piggie?

**Laura, with comic scorn:** No.Â  _\[Pause for perfect comedic timing.\]_ You're a BIG piggie!

Well, I asked.
