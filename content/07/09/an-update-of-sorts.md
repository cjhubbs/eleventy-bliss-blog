It's been slow around these parts lately, which likely just means that life has been pretty busy. Even online there have been a bunch of other projects that have been taking my time. I guess I could discuss a few of them and you might not get too bored. :-)

One of the web projects I've been working on is a new site for [Coldwater Programs](http://www.coldwaterprograms.org). Kevin Sutton is raising support for this outdoor exploration and leadership training ministry. I've done some design and layout work on the site, now it's just waiting for him to add content.

Another site that kicked off last week is the [AndrewOsenga.net forum](http://www.andrewosenga.net/forum/), which is an online home for the fan community of Andy O, as he is affectionately known. I've been happy to see folks registering and discussing thus far, I hope it will continue. I enjoy the interacting and discussing.

The other big thing coming up is the church plant. No, not the philodendron on the piano. We here at Noelridge along with a coalition of other churches in the area are planning to start a new church in downtown Cedar Rapids. We have a facility we can meet at, and we're planning on starting services on Saturday night, October 27th. The Saturday night service will be an adjustment for me, but I'm really looking forward to see what the Lord has for us down there. I'll be the music guy; I'm also doing some website design. The name isn't finalized yet, but [one potential domain name](http://www.imagochristichurch.org) has already been reserved and I've been doing some basic web design.

So at the moment it's Sunday morning and why am I blogging on Sunday morning? I'm on the laptop at church, ripping this morning's sermon audio to mp3 so it can be posted on the [church website](http://noelridge.org). Laura is downstairs in Sunday School, and Becky is off running errands. This laptop is pretty old and slow, so I have a bit of time to write before it's done ripping the audio. Then it'll be homeward bound for a bit of rest before work starts up again tomorrow. Life is busy, but life is good.
