I presented this letter to the elder board at Noelridge last Thursday:

> To the Elders at Noelridge:
> 
> It has been my privilege to serve the body at Noelridge with you for the past eight years, first as a deacon apprentice, then for a time as a deacon, then for a few years as an elder apprentice, and now for the past 18 months as an elder. You are dear brothers and friends to me, and I have learned much from each of you. However, the Lord has burdened my heart to serve fully in the upcoming church plant in downtown Cedar Rapids. As the day of the first service draws near, I find myself needing to devote more time to planning and preparation for that mission, and straining to try to remain consistent in my duties at Noelridge. I therefore request to be released from my responsibilities as an elder at Noelridge Park Church, effective immediately.
> 
> After much discussion with my wife, it is our plan that our family will attend the new church regularly and not Noelridge; our desire is for effective ministry balanced with church stability for ourselves and our daughters. I will work to make arrangements to transfer my various responsibilities to other church members over the coming weeks. I anticipate that I will continue to assist in leading music for the time being; Dave Tessier and I will work out plans to ensure that both Noelridge and the new congregation are well-led musically. We all covet your prayers as we embark on this great mission in the service of our Savior.
> 
> In Christâ€™s love,
> 
> Chris Hubbs

This is a big change for us. But we're excited about this [church plant](http://www.icatcp.org), and ready to see it happen. To my brothers and sisters at Noelridge who will undoubtedly read this and may have it be the first you've heard of it: yes, it means changes. We do have plans in the works that will mean I'll still be leading music at Noelridge once a month or so. And we'll still be around on Wednesday nights, so you haven't seen the last of Becky and the girls, either. :-) Pray for us and this church plant. We want to see great things for God's kingdom.
