The joys of having a Monday holiday: a 4-day work week, and a Tuesday that feels like Monday. Oh, and a Tuesday jammed full of meetings since they couldn't schedule 'em on Monday. (And [Geof](http://gfmorris.net), don't give me grief about "jammed full" - 4 meetings today is waaay more than my average has been for the past several months. :-) )

Overall had a nice weekend; a busy Saturday included playing a pipe organ for a wedding, which was kinda cool. Any real organist present would've recognized me for the hack organist that I am, though. My pedal skills are in the poor-to-non-existent spectrum. Also finished catching up on Harry Potter movies this weekend, and read a book called _[Making Room For Life](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Room-Life-Lifestyles-Relationships/dp/0310250161/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-5447859-1897506?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1188909757&sr=8-1)_, which was decent, but I guess I didn't find it as revolutionary and impacting as my friend (who bought it for me) did.

Now it's on to a fairly busy week; looking forward to next weekend when the cooler temps arrive (highs around 70F! Woohoo!) and my folks and brother come to visit.
