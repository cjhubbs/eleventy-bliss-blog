First off, sorry to any of you who tried to leave comments yesterday. Something with the way the upgraded theme interacts with the spam catcher is leaving something to be desired. I'm working on it, but in the mean time if it disallows a comment of yours, send me an email to let me know, would you? Thanks.

Otherwise, it's Wednesday. I am looking forward to a couple packages coming later in the week,[![green Chuck Taylors](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/6220-358437-d.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/6220-358437-d.jpg 'green Chuck Taylors') though. Tomorrow, DHL should be bringing the new shoes I ordered last night. I've had my old Converse Chuck Taylor lo-tops for a year now, and have worn them out pretty good. It was time for a new pair. This time I'm living on the wild side - instead of replacing my black ones with another black pair, I'm getting green. That should be fun. :-) I don't think I've ever had a package delivered via DHL before, and I will say now that I'm very impressed with their package tracking on their website - it seems to be more granular and updated more frequently than UPS's tracking info ever is.

Earlier in the week I got a gift card from work as an "alternative reward". Cool. Even better is that with that gift card I'm getting a set of Shure E2c headphones. I know several folks that swear by them, and I've been thinking about the purchase for a while now. They were on "clearance" at Target last week for $89, but I got 'em off Amazon for $60.

This weekend on Saturday we're headed to Des Moines overnight - we just needed to get out of town for a day or two. All my business travel has finally added up to enough Hilton rewards points to get us a free hotel room on Saturday night, and I don't have to lead music on Sunday, so we're off to visit the zoo, an orchard, and whatever else we find interesting in the big city. Can't wait.
