So we had a little fun with the webcam tonight.

The first is Laura singing her version of the ABC song:

The next is Laura singing some other songs. I didn't realize she was gonna keep singing, so the first line of the first song is cut off. Sorry.

Next are two videos of Addie hamming for the camera.

And finally, after baking cookies... it's the Swedish Chef! (I wish I had a hat!)
