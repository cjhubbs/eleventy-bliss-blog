\[As always, I am grateful to [Daniel](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/) for this very useful format.\]

- Addie didn't sleep well last night. She's getting a tight-ish cough, stuffy nose, ick. No fun.
- There's been an owl somewhere near our bedroom window for the past few nights. That rascal hooted nearly all night.
- Read Cormac McCarthy's _The Road_ in one long take last night. Chilling and bleak. Images that stick in your head.
- Result of all of the above: sleepy this morning. Very sleepy.
- It also may have something to do with all the CiCi's Pizza I ate yesterday. I think I ate a piece too much.
- A long-ish day at work today.
- Tonight we're going to see David Wilcox in concert here in CR. We're going with some new friends of ours. Should be fun. Hope I stay awake.
