- Had a productive weekend; got the lawn mowed, some concrete patching done, led music at church.
- Miserable weekend as a sports fan: Cubs played terrible and got swept; Huskers got mauled by Mizzou; Hawkeyes ran into a freight train called Penn State. At least the NHL season is new, so Dallas can't be too far out of it yet.
- I'm headed to Oklahoma City for training tomorrow. Can't imagine it'll be too exciting. Let's just see if I can get somewhere on time this time. My recent luck with flights hasn't been good. Flying United this time.
- Listening to the new album from Iron and Wine. It's good.
- I am officially now a Company Designated Engineering Representative (DER) for the FAA. I have only partial approval authority at the moment; it'll take time and experience to get full approval authority.
- It's been a week now of just bringing a bottle of pop to work in the morning rather than filling my mug at the convenience store. It's going OK. I have decided, though, that Coke Zero is too sweet for me - I like Diet Pepsi better.
