Last night Becky and I experienced a couple of firsts: 1) going to a concert at [CSPS](http://www.legionarts.org) in downtown Cedar Rapids, and 2) hearing [David Wilcox](http://www.davidwilcox.com) perform. I'll take them in that order, but the first will be brief.

CSPS is a pretty cool music venue; an arts gallery and concert stage built into the upper stories of an old warehouse building. The performance area is an intimate setting - no more than 8 or 9 rows of chairs on hand-built risers, right up near the little stage. It's designed to seat about 150, and wow, it works well. I was thinking how much fun it'd be to get any one of several [Square Pegs](http://www.squarepegalliance.com) in there... hmmm... I'll have to keep that in mind. Anyhow, pretty sweet venue.

Then we got to hear David Wilcox. This was my first experience hearing David, though I did find myself familiar with a few of his songs that have been covered by Billy Heller singing down at [Brewed Awakenings](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com). David's first set was broadcast live on [KUNI radio](http://kuniradio.org/) as part of their regular ["Live from Studio One"](http://www.kuniradio.org/kustud.html) show, which I think rearranged his setlist a bit from what he'd normally do in a concert, shifting most all of his more popular songs up front. Still, he played two great sets of songs, just him and his guitar. And quite a guitar player he is, using lots of open tunings and capos to marvelous effect. His songwriting, though, is what really shines; the phrasing and ideas of songs like [Three Brothers](http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=news&display=915) and [Show the Way](http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&display=253) just rise above the lyrical skill you usually hear from, well, about anyone. I was very, very impressed.

As I sat through the show I kept trying to decide who Wilcox reminded me of. Vocally he sounds a bit like James Taylor, but without the annoying nasal tone that Taylor has. Heck, Wilcox can really sing. And then when I was just about done being impressed with his voice, breaks out some falsetto on the last song that was just amazing. Visually, put a scruffy beard on him and give him a cane and I'd be reminded of [Dr. Greg House](http://www.fox.com/house/). There were times I was reminded of CCM artist Chris Rice, except that Wilcox reaches a level with his songwriting that Rice has never hit. I guess I don't quite have enough words to say, or, as his one song said, I really can't tell of the places I've been. Sometimes you just have to have been there. Thanks to [Nick](http://lapointemusic.com) and [Allie](http://lapointemusic.blogspot.com) for inviting us along for a great night.
