Twenty years ago today my little sister Rebecca joined the world. She has the distinction of being the youngest, cutest, and most spoiled ( ;-) ) of all the Hubbs kids. She's in Panama right now, so I don't know how soon she'll see this, but anyway: Happy Birthday, sis. Hope you have a great day. Looking forward to seeing you again at Christmas.

And, because I can, here's one of my favorite photos of Reba in recent memory. Love ya, sis!
