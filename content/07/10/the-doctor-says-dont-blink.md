I haven't enjoyed a single episode of TV quite so much in a while. I'm a couple weeks behind on Dr. Who, but finally watched the episode called "[Blink](http://www.scifi.com/doctorwho/episodes/episodes.php?seas=3&ep=0310&act=1)" tonight. A very, very good episode. \[Spoilers ahead, so if you're going to watch it and want to be surprised, don't read on.\]

First of all, the idea of weeping stone angels as quantum-locked beings who are only alive when no one is looking at them? Awesome. Now, the whole time-travel plot device of having someone send messages to themself in the past is far from new - Phillip K. Dick wrote a short story with that premise, which got adapted into a so-so movie called _[Paycheck](http://imdb.com/title/tt0338337/)_ a few years back. But it was really well done here. And the whole final scene where the human has one-up on the Doctor, because she knows what's gonna happen, and he doesn't yet? Brilliant. And so well done.

Dr. Who can be really cheesy at times, but this season has done well. And _Blink_ is definitely the best episode to date.
