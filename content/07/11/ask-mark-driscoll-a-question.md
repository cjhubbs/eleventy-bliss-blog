[Mars Hill Church](http://marshillchurch.org) in Seattle has a neat opportunity going on right now with the ["Ask Anything" promotion](http://askanything.marshillchurch.org/). Visitors to askanything.marshillchurch.org were able to post questions that they'd like Pastor Mark Driscoll to answer. They held voting for a while and narrowed it down to the Top 50. Now they're voting to select the Top 9 from that list. You're allowed up to 10 votes per day, every day. Pastor Mark will take the top vote-getters and preach sermons on them in the spring of 2008. Pretty cool, huh?

Looking at the questions in the top 50, though, I'm torn. Most of the questions seem to be real, legitimate, "I want teaching on this" or "I'd like an explanation of this" kinds of questions - things like

> ["What can traditional churches learn from emerging churches?"](http://askanything.marshillchurch.org/alphas/219-what-can-traditional-established-churches-learn-from-emerging-churches)

and

> [Why do you make jokes about mormon missionaries, homosexuals, trenchcoats wearers, single men, vegans, emo kids and then expect these groups to come to know God in the same sermon?](http://askanything.marshillchurch.org/alphas/66-why-do-you-make-jokes-about-mormon-missionaries-homosexuals-trenchcoats-wearers-single-men-vegans-emo-kids-and-then-expect-these-groups-to-come-to-know-god-in-the-same-sermon)

and this fun one:

> [How should one apply biblical principles to today's blogging culture? (gossip, slander, repentance, church discipline, pastoral authority, etc.)](http://askanything.marshillchurch.org/alphas/96-how-should-one-apply-biblical-principles-to-today-s-blogging-culture-gossip-slander-repentance-church-discipline-pastoral-authority-etc)

And those are questions I really wish Pastor Mark would answer. His take would be helpful, fun, and potentially insightful.

However, I'd like to encourage Pastor Mark in this: ignore question number one. The current number one vote-getting question:

> [Do you believe that the Scripture not only regulates our theology but also our methodology? In other words, do you believe in the regulative principle? If so, to what degree? If not, why not?](http://askanything.marshillchurch.org/alphas/185-do-you-believe-that-the-scripture-not-only-regulates-our-theology-but-also-our-methodology-in-other-words-do-you-believe-in-the-regulative-principle-if-so-to-what-degree-if-not-why-not)

To me, this one really feels like Driscoll's critics are looking for something else to give them ammunition against him. Really, outside of people for whom this is a really big deal and aren't going to change their minds on the subject anyway, who even really knows about the regulative principle? _Obviously_ Driscoll doesn't believe in the regulative principle, folks - just visit Mars Hill for a Sunday and you'll see they're singing stuff that isn't directly from the Psalter. Does Pastor Mark need to spend an hour on a Sunday morning explaining why he doesn't believe in it just to add fuel to his critics' fire? I think not.

Another one to ignore: [this question](http://askanything.marshillchurch.org/alphas/119-pastor-mark-you-have-stated-that-you-do-not-believe-in-the-rapture-what-are-your-beliefs-surrounding-issues-of-eschatology-and-the-current-christian-infatuation-with-the-apocalypse) on the end times.

Head over to [askanything.marshillchurch.org](http://askanything.marshillchurch.org), check out the questions, vote for the ones you'd like to hear Pastor Mark answer. And Pastor Mark, please, skip #1.
