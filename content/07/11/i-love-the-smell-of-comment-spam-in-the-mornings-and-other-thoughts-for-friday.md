Yep, 105 comments held in moderation. All of 'em spam. I guess I should tighten up Spam Karma 2 a little bit. But still, not hard to bulk-moderate 'em all into oblivion.

Other thoughts from the week:

- Cell phones showed up yesterday via Fedex. It was easy to activate them, then dialed 0 to get out of a weird automated service and talked to a very nice real person at Verizon who got our number port going.
- One odd thing: in the store and on their website, Verizon claims that porting a number over will take between one and four hours. When I actually initiated the port yesterday afternoon, the woman told me it could take up to 72 hours. It's been 16 hours so far, and still nothing.
- We've had colds most all week at our house. Not fun. Haven't actually slept through the night in a couple of weeks. No wonder I'm tired.
- Going back to Standard Time from Daylight Time makes it feel like winter to me. That's what I associate with winter: that it's dark by suppertime. And so it is this week. On the positive side, we've been getting to bed earlier, though whether that's due more to the time change or the sickness is anyone's guess.
- It sounds like we are ever-so-close to having a building deal done for our church plant. It will be nice to get a start date set and then get this thing going. I'm guessing the first Saturday in January - that would be 1/5/08.
- I had no meetings scheduled at work yesterday, and none again today. Must be some kind of record. Not that I'm complaining.

So that's pretty much my week. Not very exciting.

Oh, one last thing I should mention: congratulations to my friend Geof who [has won a Space Flight Awareness Award](http://ijsm.org/archives/2007/11/08/space-flight-awareness-honoree/) from NASA. It's a big deal. Wish I could come with you to see the shuttle launch, G, but I don't think I'll get free. And I'm not a single woman, either, so I'm a bit out of your target demographic. ;-)
