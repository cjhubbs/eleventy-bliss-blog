So it's been a nice weekend. Ryan decided at the last minute to come visit for the holiday, so we've enjoyed his company over the long weekend. Watched a lot of football, ate a bunch of tasty food, and now the weekend is over. Still, only a month until Christmas. :-)

At the moment I'm waiting for my flight from Cedar Rapids to take me to Atlanta, which in turn will connect to Savannah, GA. This flight was supposed to leave about 3 pm today, but is now looking more like 5:20 pm. I think my connection in Atlanta will be delayed enough that I can make it. I'm happy that Atlanta is getting rain and all, but couldn't they have gotten it tomorrow after I'm there?!? This is the part of air travel that I so dislike. Ah well.

Tomorrow evening I'm planning on meeting a college friend (Daniel Schaffhauser, if that name rings a bell) and his family for some supper and time to visit. Should be a good time. Otherwise, I don't know what Savannah will hold for me, though I've had a slew of recommendations. So little time to play tourist... but ya gotta roll with it. What else can you do?
