Got a long-awaited phone call from my youngest brother Andrew last weekend with some fantastic news: he and Heather are officially engaged to be married. I was hoping to post a picture with this, so I went to Facebook, and, well, [it didn't disappoint](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=31513&id=567460551&ref=nf). (You have to be Andrew's friend on Facebook to see the album.)

A few observable facts:

- They seem so young! And yet, assuming a summer 2008 wedding, Andrew will be older than I was when Becky and I got married.
- Becky and I were never this adorably cute.
- It's been almost 10 years since the last Hubbs kid got married. Hope it's not another 10 years before the next one!

I had a hard time deciding which pictures to post here - they're all so darn cute. But here is just a taste. (Click the pics to enlarge.)
