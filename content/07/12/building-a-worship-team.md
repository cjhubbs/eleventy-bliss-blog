One of my big initial tasks for Imago Christi is to figure out the worship team situation. Music is going to be an important part of our church "feel". I had to select a word carefully there. Music won't be the most important part of the church, not by a long shot. Nor will it be the most important part of the worship service. But music sets the tone, the "feel", for the service and the congregation. Our music at Imago needs to draw from both ancient and modern, to be current musically while capturing the richness of two millenia of church tradition, wisdom, and teaching.

With that mental framework in place I start to look for musicians and vocalists. In the end I picture a small band; drums, a guitar or two, keyboard, bass, and a few vocals. But we'll start smaller than that. It looks like our inaugural service will be keys, (conga) drums, and maybe an acoustic guitar. Three of us on vocals. We'll see where it goes from there. I'm a lousy recruiter. I hate asking people to do things. I want people who are self-motivated and _want_ to participate on the team. When God brings them, we'll add them in. Am I being naive about this?

First practice is Thursday night. I can't wait.
