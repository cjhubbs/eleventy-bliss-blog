- I've stuck you, my blog readers, with far too many links this week and not enough other stuff. Now, that being said, they are all good links. You'll find good stuff if you visit them.
- Finally thinking about Christmas shopping. I think it's gonna be a Amazon year. I have some good book ideas for almost everybody.
- Chatted with Ryan for a while yesterday and it's interesting to see us progressing remarkably parallel paths of theological thought and reading. Makes me wonder what it was in our common upbringing that's moving us that way.
- In the same chat conversation there were enough ideas come up to give me an outline for one of those books that I'd love to write but keep lamenting I never have the time for. I really should make an effort.
- Tonight we're doing Texas Roadhouse for dinner. Becky's been looking forward to steak all week. Hooray for Christmas bonuses!
- [Church plant](http://www.icatcp.org) update: the lease agreement for the building was signed yesterday. Assuming the other party signs it (which they should), we're officially in the building and will be starting January 5. Awesome and scary at the same time.
- You know, if you go back to the real [definition](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/awe) of awesome, something that inspires "an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, fear, etc., produced by that which is grand, sublime, extremely powerful, or the like", then the scary part I juxtaposed in the previous bullet is pretty much redundant.
