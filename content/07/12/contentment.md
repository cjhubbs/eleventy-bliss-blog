I was reading Psalm 131 this morning and was struck by the picture of contentment painted in its three short verses:

> O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me. But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me.
> 
> O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.

With two small girls at our house, this picture is a familiar one. When Laura snuggles up on my wife's lap, she is the picture of contentment. She's not worried about things "too great and marvelous" - she just wants to rest and to feel the love of her mother. She is secure in the arms of one who she knows loves her, will care for her, and will keep her safe. So she sits quietly, peaceful in the knowledge that she's in good hands, and content.

As God's people our hope and contentment is in the Lord. He can handle the great and marvelous things. I want to focus on resting in Him and trusting His goodness today.
