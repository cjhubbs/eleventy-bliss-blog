I'm convinced that picking a good Church Management Software (CMS from here on out) will be an important thing for [Imago Christi](http://imagochristicp.org). So for the past couple of days I've spent some time Googling various CMS options. There is no shortage of options; the Google search has multiple pages of primary sites that offer some sort of software, and those software packages seem to run the whole gamut. There are the amazingly cheap and out-of-date packages that are still being offered; there are more expensive packages available. One particular frustration is that a bunch of sites won't even give you pricing information up front; they want your contact info so they can have someone call you. I hate talking to salesmen, and there's no sense in them pitching a $1000 software package to me, no matter how good it is - we can't afford it.

Being a geek and very internet-savvy, it boggles my mind how many really _really_ poor websites there are for these programs. Seriously, the sites look like they were created in 1995 by a high-schooler who needed a weekend project. And like they haven't been updated since then. I have to wonder how many copies of the software they're selling if they can't even afford a decent website.

There are a couple options I have found that have web-based solutions that are very attractive: [PurposeWare](http://www.purposeware.com) and [Church Community Builder](http://www.churchcommunitybuilder.com). Both appear to be much more robust than the typical CMS, allowing church members to access the tool online to update information, sign up for mailing lists, etc. Of course, both of these places want me to leave my contact info so they can get back to me... but I think with these two it'll be worth it. At least these two have websites that I wouldn't be embarrassed to have associated with my organization.

I'll do some more evaluation in the next week and try to come up with a recommendation. Then we just need to justify it in the budget...
