What a great Christmas, and now how good to be home. We spent several days at my parents' place in Wisconsin, though for the first day or so they weren't there... they had to go to Chicago to pick up my sister, who flew in from Panama, and my brother, who flew in from DC. They made it within about 30 miles of home before the snow storm got so intense that they couldn't manage to get any further. So they got a room, stayed the night, and waited for the snow plows. By noon the next day they made it home. It was sure good to see everyone.

Christmas was a marvelous time. It's always such fun with small children, and Laura and Addie just loved opening their presents and playing with their new toys. The carnage comes when we bring them all home and add them to the existing pile of toys. I think it's time for a garage sale or a large donation to Goodwill.

We did manage to get at least one decent family picture taken, so here we wish you a belated Merry Christmas! (For family and friends: I'll get a bunch more uploaded to Flickr sometime this week.)
