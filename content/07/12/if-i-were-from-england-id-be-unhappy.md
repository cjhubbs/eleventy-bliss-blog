Becky and I were wandering the toy shelves at our local Target store recently, finishing up some Christmas shopping for the girls. On one shelf I saw this little set of dolls:

A couple of thoughts came to mind: first, how quaint! This reminds me of something out of the early 20th century, all nicely culturally stereotyped in ethnic garb. I am surprised that the PC police haven't come down on it. But then I looked a little closer, and noticed this particular doll, which you can still make out even with the fuzzy picture quality from my camera phone:

Notice anything wrong? Yep, the doll is supposed to represent England, but _she's wearing Scottish plaid_. If I were from England, I'd be unhappy. Obviously, somebody from Target (or whoever in China designs their toys) doesn't realize that Scotland /= England. Ah well, a geography lesson for another day.
