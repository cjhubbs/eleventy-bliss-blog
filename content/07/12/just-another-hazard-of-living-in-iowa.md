OK, so there aren't too many hazards living in Iowa as compared to anywhere else in the USA, but one, for sure, is that every four years we get some ridiculous media attention leading up to the caucuses. They're coming up this Thursday, and then, please God, maybe we can be done with the attention and the advertising for a while.

A couple of weeks ago a reporter from Newsweek contacted an elder at Noelridge and wanted to know if she could come interview some of our folks to do an online piece on Iowans in preparation for the caucuses. The end result is a [three-minute video](http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1243698382/bclid1137752368/bctid1352562210) that most prominently features our pastor, Richard Marsceau. You can also hear me plunking away at the piano and singing through the last minute or so. Pretty cool stuff.

[Watch the video here.](http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1243698382/bclid1137752368/bctid1352562210) Sorry, Mom and Dad, it'll probably be impossible to watch via dial-up. I've got it saved, though, so remind me next time you come visit.
