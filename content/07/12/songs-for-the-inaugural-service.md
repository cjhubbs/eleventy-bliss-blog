[Imago Christi](http://www.imagochristicp.org)'s inaugural service is just over a week away - January 5, 2008. [As I noted previously](/07/12/selecting-music-for-an-inaugural-service/), it's a bit of a challenge to pick the music - something appropriate for the first service of a new church, setting the tone for services to come, and having something accessible for those who are coming who may not be familiar with the songs.

I've settled on these four:

Blessed Be The Name of the Lord (Clinton Utterbach)  
Praise to the Lord, The Almighty  
My All In All (Dennis Jernigan)   
Jesus, I Come (with new tune from RUF Hymnal)  

I think this keeps things relatively simple, yet incorporates some new and old lyrics of praise of the Father, praise of the Son as the Lamb of God, and a beautiful expression of the Gospel in the final hymn. I pray it will be a blessing to those who attend.
