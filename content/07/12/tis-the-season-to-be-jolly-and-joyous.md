[Christmas shopping is complete.](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2007/12/14/christmas-shopping-complete-in-record-time/) The [Christmas program](http://www.imagochristicp.org/2007/11/19/cocoa-and-carols-december-15/) is over. We've received a bunch of Christmas cards already. We still haven't gotten any sent. ![:-(](http://thehubbs.net/chris/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif) Apologies in advance to organized friends like Stephanie and the Hollands. It's not that we don't appreciate you thinking of us and sending us the pictures. We do, really. We're just not organized enough to get our own sent out this year. When I was growing up it was the family joke that we would send out a New Year's letter, because our Christmas letter always went out really late. I think this Hubbs household might have to do the same thing.

Tasks for this week: baking cookies. Well, that's mostly Becky. She has baked so many cookies this last week already. Toll House cookies. Chocolate Espresso cookies. O'Henry bars. Chocolate chip cookie dough balls. I know the Chex Mix is coming up yet this week. She has a schedule for every day divided up into morning, afternoon, and evening, with baking tasks laid out appropriately so that she can finish before we head to Wisconsin on Saturday. I am impressed, as usual, with her organizational determination.

Other tasks for this week: Wrapping presents. Just because they're all bought doesn't mean they're ready for Christmas. We'll load up the coffee table downstairs with all the wrapping implements and then turn something on the TV. I'm thinking it'll be more Heroes. I never watched Heroes when it started last year on TV, and once I got behind, I knew it was no use trying to start in the middle. So I got Season 1 and we've been saving it until we had time. Now with the writer's strike and no new shows to watch, it's the perfect time. We watched five episodes over the weekend. Totally hooked. If not Heroes, it'll be time to break out the Muppet Christmas Carol. It is pretty much a yearly tradition - who can fail to love Kermit as Bob Crachit and Michael Caine as Mr. Scrooge? So much fun.

I'm taking Friday off work to get a head start on the holidays. Then we pack and head off to see the family. Lots to do between now and then, though. After all, it's only one more week 'til Christmas.
