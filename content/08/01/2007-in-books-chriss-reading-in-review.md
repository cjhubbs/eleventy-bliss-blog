One year ago I decided that my blog was the must useful place to keep my reading list, and that proved to be a good choice. I've tried keeping reading lists in the past, but was never consistent in recording. This year, though, I managed to record each book and a couple sentences of synopsis and review. I don't do much in the way of Top 10 lists, but this seems like one place where I have enough data at hand to make a year-end summary. So here goes.

[**Full list of books I read in 2007.**](http://thehubbs.net/chris/books-ive-read-in-2007/)

Total books read: 85. Total fiction: 68. Total non-fiction: 17. Total re-reads: 1.

The one notable series for this year was Harry Potter. I managed to resist the series until this year, but finally decided it was time to give them a try. I was glad I did; they were some very entertaining reads. I started Book 1 on July 11 and finished Book 7 on August 23, and managed to sneak six other books in during that six weeks as well!

A look at my non-fiction stuff betrays my interest in history and science, with a dabbling in music. No real surprises, I guess.

My Top 5 non-fiction reads of the year, in no particular order:

- [The Everlasting Man](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0486460363%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0486460363%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - G. K. Chesterton. This is a classic, took me a while to read, but Chesterton is worth it.
- [Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0743270754%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0743270754%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Doris Kearns Goodwin. Goodwin makes history interesting. Very readable, interesting insights into an amazing man.
- [Chosen Soldier: The Making of a Special Forces Warrior](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0307339386%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0307339386%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Dick Couch. I'm a sucker for special forces/military stuff anyway, and this is an excellent look at what the Army Special Forces folks do.
- [No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0684804484%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0684804484%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Doris Kearns Goodwin. Got started on DKG, read a second book. Good stuff once again.
- [A More Perfect Constitution: 23 Proposals to Revitalize Our Constitution and Make America a Fairer Country](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0802716210%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0802716210%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Larry J. Sabato. Some very interesting ideas here, including changing the number of senators/representatives and the lengths of their term, a proposal for a single six-year (extendable to eight-year via national referendum) term for president, and others.

My top 8 fiction reads, again in no particular order (I was going to list 10, but couldn't find two more that lived up to the standards of these 8):

- [Variable Star](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0765351684%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0765351684%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Robert Heinlein & Spider Robinson. The title character goes on a "galactic bender"... yeah, and it's a great story.
- [Sun of Suns (Virga, Book 1)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0765354535%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0765354535%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Karl Schroeder. Schroeder manages to create a very believable, imaginative world for his story. I've got book 2 sitting in my to-read pile right now. Can't wait.
- [In War Times](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0765313553%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0765313553%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Kathleen Ann Goonan. Goonan combines time travel, jazz, and World War II in a way that blows my mind. Easily my favorite non-series book of the year.
- [The Children of HÃºrin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0618894640%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0618894640%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien does the classic epic better than anyone else.
- [Magic Street](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0345416902%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0345416902%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Orson Scott Card. Card has a gift for storytelling and imagination. This novel weaves some of the plot and ideas of Shakespeare's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ into a delightful modern fantasy.
- [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0545010225%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0545010225%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - J. K. Rowling. I promised myself I'd only include one HP book in this list, and it had to be this one. It caps off the series brilliantly.
- [Overclocked: Stories of the Future Present](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1560259817%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1560259817%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Cory Doctorow. Most of the sci-fi short stories I've read up to this point have been older; it's fun to read something written recently - the current-ness of the technology and ideas makes them even more believable and frightening.
- [The Road](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0307387895%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0307387895%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02) - Cormac McCarthy. No, I didn't read this one because Oprah recommended it. [Andrew Peterson recommended it, too!](http://www.rabbitroom.com/?p=332) :-) Chilling, spare, and yet ultimately hopeful.

Apparently I am a sci-fi nerd. It's not that all I read is sci-fi... I guess those just stick out the most to me.

I'll start a new list for 2008 once I finish my first book. Gotta see how my reading preferences change from year to year.
