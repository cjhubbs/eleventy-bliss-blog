My mom has mentioned more than once how she enjoys seeing our girls' personalities as they get bigger and start to really develop. She sees Laura as having more of my personality: quiet, methodical, the classic introverted engineer. (Poor kid!) Addie, on the other hand, is the more ornery outgoing one, much like my brother Ryan. I knew I more or less agreed with Mom, but saw it very clearly last night.

We showed up at church around 5 pm to get ready for Wednesday night dinner (which we were serving). The daycare kids who occupy our basement after school were just getting ready to leave. Of course Laura and Addie wanted to play with them, and for a few minutes both of them did. But it was only a couple minutes later that Laura started feeling overwhelmed by the group of noisy kids, and she retreated into the kitchen with us. She was much happier just hanging out there where it was quiet.

But Addie? She was wearing a necklace of gold plastic beads that she got from a parade this summer; it has a big gold plastic disc pendant that advertises a local bank. Since the kids didn't know her name, they saw the bling and started calling her "hip-hop baby". She spent the next 10+ minutes chasing them around, teasing them, ducking into the kitchen where they weren't allowed, only to then poke her head out, get them to scream, chase after them a bit... All the more hilarious because she's not yet 2 and they were all between 8 and 10.

Parenting is so much fun.
