- Playing basketball three times a week is good for your game and your weight, but sure does make you sore.
- Hard to believe it's almost February already. Next weekend: trip to Lincoln, NE to see Caedmon's Call and Andy O.
- Five-hour road trip to see said musicians: seems relatively short. Oh, and Mom is coming down to watch the girls so Becky and I get a couple days out to ourselves!
- Doing double-duty this weekend - leading at both [Imago](http://imagochristicp.org) and [Noelridge](http://www.noelridge.org).
- I've registered a domain name to hang out a shingle for web design services. Don't know how much business I'll manage to drum up, but after doing so many freebie websites for friends over the past several years, it's fun to think that I could actually get paid for it instead.
- [Tweet140](http://www.tweet140.com/user/cjhubbs/) mocks me even as I'm writing this post.
- Haven't traveled for work yet this year but that's gonna change soon - there's the threat of a last-minute trip to Seattle in mid-February, and a scheduled trip to Augusta, GA in early March.
- I think I might actually only finish two books in January, which is a real low for me. It's not that I haven't been reading - it's that I've been reading a long, thick book that has to be read slowly.

This excuse for a real post brought to you by the two Advil I took with breakfast this morning.
