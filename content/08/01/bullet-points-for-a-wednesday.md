- Just realized I never gave you all any feedback on the first service at Imago Christi. It went pretty well - had 60 in attendance. Music was OK, though I starting singing the wrong verse of one hymn at one point, which threw everybody off. :-(
- Just started my new book list for 2008. You can find the link on the sidebar. Only one book on it so far.
- I have resolved to not get any more books from the library until I read through the pile that's next to my bed. It has grown to where it won't fit under the lip of the bedside table any more - must be 15 books there. They're good things that I want to read, I just keep preempting them with newer stuff from the library. Gotta whittle that pile down.
- Just heard that Andrew Peterson will be doing a concert in Cedar Rapids the day after my birthday. Happy Birthday to me! Hey Andrew and Heather, when will you be back in the area for spring break? Want to come down to CR?
- Speaking of Andrew and Heather, we've been plotting (well, Becky's been plotting) our trip to WA this summer for the wedding. It's looking like fun.
- Next note on the wedding: I'm gonna have to buy a suit. I haven't owned a suit in years. The blazer I wore during college hasn't fit me through the shoulders since probably 2000.
- It's harder than it should be to remember that the Saturday night service at Imago wasn't a one-time event. I've got to plan music for this Saturday... should do that today.
