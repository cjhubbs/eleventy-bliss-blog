I've basically narrowed down our web-based CMS search to two programs: [Church Community Builder](http://www.churchcommunitybuilder.com) and [PurposeWare](http://www.purposeware.com). I've worked with the online demo of CCB for a few days now and liked what I've seen. It is _very_ feature-rich and detailed. My fear is that it might be _too_ detailed and might scare away potential users. I haven't seen PurposeWare up close yet; they will schedule a live demo for me with a sales person, but I can't just go do it myself. No time to do it this week; I think I'll set aside some time next week to get the demo.

Both companies have reduced pricing in place for church plants; PurposeWare says they'll give it to us for free for a year, but haven't told me yet how much it'll cost after that. I have a price on CCB that I think we could handle if it's the best choice. I'm shooting for next week sometime to get a decision made and get signed up.
