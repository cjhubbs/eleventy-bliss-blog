Saturday was the big day - first service at [Imago Christi](http://www.imagochristicp.org)! A timeline of the day:

**7:30 am:** Wake up after sleeping in. Feels good. Making mental lists of what I need to remember for the service.

**9:45 am:** Everyone is fed and dressed. Making a couple final tweaks to the bulletin.

**9:55 am:** Headed to Noelridge to print the bulletin and pick up the drums.

**10:30 am:** Setting out 2008 giving envelopes for Noelridge while the bulletins print.

**10:50 am:** Loading congas, microphones, mic stands, and a small podium into the van.

**12:10 pm:** Girls are taking a nap, Becky and I are watching Heroes. Almost done with Season One.

**12:30 pm:** Nate calls and wants to know when we can meet so he can drop off the sound equipment. Any time before 3:30 will work for him.

**1:15 pm:** Meet Nate at Imago. Set up speakers, amp, adjust the EQ.

**1:45 pm:** Heading back home.

**3:15 pm:** Leaving to pick up Andre and head to Imago for worship team practice.

**3:30 pm:** Made it to Imago, setting up microphones and the keyboard. How will we arrange all this stuff on the stage?

**4:00 pm:** Finally ready to practice the music. Getting a nasty hum from the passive pickup in Morgan's guitar.

**5:00 pm:** We're as practiced as we're going to be. Plugging in the iPod. Andrew Peterson will provide background music until the service starts.

**5:15 pm:** Changing into my [ilikeandy.com](http://ilikeandy.com) t-shirt and a jacket.

**5:30 pm:** Service starting. Must be about 50 people here.

**5:35 pm:** We're up. Music starts. People are clapping on the first song. Woohoo!

**5:39 pm:** This second song is a mess. Timing is off, and I messed up the lyrics to the second verse. Not my A game. Grrrr.

**5:50 pm:** Music set is done. Still pondering what song to use as the musical meditation at the end of the service.

**6:40 pm:** Richard has finally wrapped up the sermon. Taking mental notes to give him a review later. I've decided on a song.

**6:50 pm:** First service is over, and we survived. Thank God. Heading down for a fellowship time.

**7:15 pm:** Tearing down sound equipment. Fortunately we have a closet where we can store it there at the church.

**7:45 pm:** Everything is torn down and put away. Now to lug those congas back out to the car so we can use 'em at Noelridge in the morning.

**8:10 pm:** Home. Exhausted. Putting the girls to bed.

**8:30 pm:** Watching the last three episodes of Season One of Heroes. Pretty good ending.
