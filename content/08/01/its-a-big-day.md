We've been working towards this for over a year now, and tonight it comes to pass: the first service at our downtown Cedar Rapids church plant, [Imago Christi at Central Park](http://www.imagochristicp.org). I think we're to the point where we've planned about as much as we can; now we just have to go for it and trust God to see us through. This is the point where the butterflies set in.

Pray for us today that we would be effective, and above all else, that God would be glorified.

(5:30 pm if you're in CR and want to come!)
