If there was ever a "perfect" album to come out of the (largely mediocre) world of CCM, Rich Mullins' _A Liturgy, a Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band_ was it. (Are the 'A's supposed to be capitalized? It looks funny either way.) This album is fifteen (fifteen!) years old this year, and yet still sounds as fresh and vital as when it was released. If you're not familiar with the album, let me give you an overview. (If you _are_ familiar with the album, you won't mind the refresher at all.)

Split into two halves, the first half is the splendid Liturgy. _Here In America_ is the [_Introit_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introit), or entrance. It is followed by the stunning text of (Isaiah) _52:10_, the hymn of praise recognizing the beauty of creation called _The Color Green_, the supplicant's prayer _Hold Me Jesus_, the bold restatement of the (Apostle's) _Creed_, and _Peace_, helpfully subtitled _A Communion Blessing from St. Joseph's Square_. Each song in itself is excellent, and as a set they reach the level of masterpiece. When, in _Peace_, Rich starts the first two verses with this juxtaposition

> Though we're strangers, still I love you  
> I love you more than your mask  
> And you know you have to trust this to be true  
> And I know that's much to ask...
> <br/>
> ...  
> <br/>
> And though I love you, still we're strangers  
> Prisoners in these lonely hearts  
> And though our blindness separates us  
> Still a light shines in the dark...

We understand immediately the tension of the Christian fellowship - bound by the love of Christ, and yet so frustratingly driven apart by our sinful humanity. It's beautiful stuff from beginning to end.

The second half is the Legacy: a reflection on life. It starts with the upbeat instrumental _78 Eatonwood Green_, then moves into the challenge of being like Jesus (_Hard_), the challenge of living life away from family (_I'll Carry On_), a child's wonder at Christmas (_You Gotta Get Up_), the challenge and frustration of the world we live in (Mark Heard's _How To Grow Up Big and Strong_), and finally the most beautiful picture you'll ever hear painted of the tension of living in a country you love while simultaneously looking forward to the heavenly home (_Land of my Sojurn_).

> Nobody tells you when you get born here  
> How much you're going to love it and how you'll never belong here  
> So I'll call you my country, but I'll be longing for my home  
>And I wish that I could take you there with me...

And the Ragamuffin Band? Well, they sound fantastic. From Rich's clear piano and the cymbals mirroring the ocean's crashing in _Here In America_, to the mellow electric guitar and _fantastic_ drum fills in _Peace_, to the dulcimer driving _Land of my Sojurn_, the album has an organic acoustic sound that rightfully has become the inspiration for a younger generation of musicians. My first inclination is to say that it is lightning in a bottle, that it'll never be captured that way again. But then I listen to the guitars of [Andrew Peterson](http://www.andrew-peterson.com) and [Andy Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com), the piano of [Ben Shive](http://www.benshive.com), and the percussion of [Todd Bragg and Garrett Buell](http://www.caedmonscall.com), and I will instead be thankful that the musical and songwriting heritage of Rich Mullins has indeed carried on.
