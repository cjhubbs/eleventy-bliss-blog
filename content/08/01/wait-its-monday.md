Weekends are going to look a little bit different now that we're having church on Saturday night. Something to get used to. This weekend was actually pretty great; a phone call from my sister saying "hey, we're bored, can we come visit this afternoon?" changed our direction pretty quickly. So the folks and Rebecca came down in time for church on Saturday night and then hung around on Sunday until late afternoon. It was great to see them and hang out.

Saturday night went well down at Imago Christi - certainly better than the first week. Sermon was tighter, music was more together, adding Dave Paris on the guitar with the worship team was a big plus. Picking a song for the meditation after the sermon continues to be a challenge - it's just hard to know what the right song will be until I hear the message. Saturday night I wanted to use the song "Jesus, Name above all Names", but the 70's style of the original song was turning me off to it. So for the last five minutes of the sermon I worked out a new tune in my head, and then sang it. It actually sounded pretty good. I should go write it down while I still remember it. :-)

Watched a bunch of football yesterday and was surprised and disappointed to see the Colts lose to the Chargers; not so surprised or disappointed to see the Cowboys lose. I'm gonna have to cheer for the Packers from here on out. There has to be _somebody_ who can beat the Patriots.

Well, that's your weekend update from Iowa. It's now Monday morning and there's work to be done.
