So back in my [Caedmon's concert post](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/02/11/putting-on-the-miles/), [Daniel](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/) [commented](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/02/11/putting-on-the-miles/#comment-19023) that he found the length of that road trip to see a concert "insane". Being the nerd that I am, I decided an "equation of insanity" would be appropriate. ([Geof's](http://www.ijsm.org) [equation of motivation](http://ijsm.org/archives/2003/11/26/an-equation-of-motivation/) was an additional piece of inspiration.)

So, without further ado, the equation:

I = (d+t)/qL

Where

I = relative insanity of the trip d = distance traveled to the concert t = time that trip took q = quality of the artist you are going to see L = length of the concert.

Of course the tricky thing here is that the q value will vary between persons, so just because you think my trip is insane doesn't mean that I will agree with you. Also, by including not only the distance of the trip but also its' duration, trips like [Geof's planned flight to Philly](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/02/11/putting-on-the-miles/#comment-19002) aren't as insane as if he were to, say, drive to Philly.

There's also the issue of _theoretical_ insanity versus _actual_ insanity. For instance, [my trip to see Andy O's _The Morning_ release show](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/06/28/road-trip-andy-o-cd-release-show/) theoretically should be much more insane because of the distance to Nashville, but in actuality the concert was so awesome that the real insanity level was much lower.

_Note to Becky, my Mom, etc: Yes, this really just means that I am a huge nerd. Not exactly a revelation. :-)_
