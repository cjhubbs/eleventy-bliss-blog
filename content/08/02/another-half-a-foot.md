Rest easy, friends, I'm not growing some fractional appendage. But I am pretty much tired of winter. Whatever the steps are in dealing with issues, well, I've moved past frustration and anger on to acceptance. It's just more snow. Half an inch of ice to start it off? Well sure, why not? We can use the variety. I _am_ glad this year, though, for the snowblower.

Two weeks from now I will be jetting off for a week in Augusta, GA. I can hardly wait to feel the warmth. The highs for this upcoming week, per weather.com? 11째F, 14째F, 10째F, and 19째F. Windchills down below zero most of the week. Now, I know that this winter is likely a climatological statistical anomaly that has no bearing on the validity of "global warming", but the cynical part of me would like to invite Al Gore to move to Iowa for a few winters like this one. Right about now I'd be happy to trade him and move down to Tennessee.

At least when it gets cold in Wisconsin they can call it "The Frozen Tundra", and it sounds cool. Here in Iowa it's just more snow and ice and cold. And in Wisconsin they specialize in cheese... which would go pretty well with this whine.
