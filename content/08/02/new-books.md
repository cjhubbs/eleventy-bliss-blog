Very few things do I enjoy more than finally getting my hands on a new book that I'd been looking forward to. This week is like the double-bonus: Tim Keller's _[The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism](http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/5318/nm/The_Reason_for_God_Belief_in_an_Age_of_Skepticism_Hardcover_)_ and N.T. Wright's _[Suprised By Hope: Rethinking the Resurrection and the Mission of the Church](http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/5528/nm/Surprised_by_Hope_Rethinking_Heaven_the_Resurrection_and_the_Mission_of_the_Church_Hardcover_)_. I'm about a third of the way through Keller's book, and I'm quite enjoying it. Nothing groundbreaking so far, but he provides solid, consistent answers to common objections to Christianity in his usual understated, lucid style. You've read a lot of the same stuff from C. S. Lewis in _The Abolition of Man_ and other volumes, but Keller lays it out in a very readable style. Can't wait to get to the end.

I'm almost more keen (if that's possible) to wade through Wright's latest tome. My only fear is that if I end up agreeing with him too much I may start to run afoul of the standard evangelical dispensational and pre-mil standpoint that is codified in Noelridge's (and Imago Christi's) doctrinal statements. But I need to wade through it and wrestle with it. I've heard a bunch of recordings of the talks that Wright has given on the end times over the past couple of years, and they've made a lot of sense. So I'm very happy to have a more concrete, written version to work through. Expect some blog posts on that topic.

It's not a book, but on a separate note, I picked up _Say I Am You_, the latest CD from The Weepies, with a gift card yesterday on [Geof](http://gfmorris.net)'s recommendation. Good stuff.
