Tim Keller has been a favorite speaker of mine for some time now. As pastor of [Redeemer Presbyterian Church](http://www.redeemer.com/) in New York City, he reaches thousands each week. He has also become a fixture at pastor's conferences including John Piper's conference in Minneapolis (where I saw Keller in person a couple years ago) and Mark Driscoll's Acts 29 conferences. His dry wit and humor coupled with great insight on ministering to the city make him a must-listen for me.

(As a brief aside, I made this analogy at Piper's conference a couple years ago: if Piper's conference were Star Wars, Mark Driscoll would be Han Solo, Piper would be Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Tim Keller is quite easily Yoda. _Quite_ easily.)

When I heard that he had written a new book, I eagerly ordered it (thank you, [wtsbooks.com](http://wtsbooks.com)) and put it at the top of my reading stack.

God and Reason have been hot topics lately in the book world; it seems to be the topic _du jure_ for atheists who want to trash Christianity. Keller's book seems to be something of a response to those books, proposing, as the title suggests, _The Reason for God_. There has been significant buzz in the Christian blogosphere surrounding the book, and a not-insignificant marketing blitz as well - it's not often that a new Christian apologetic comes complete with [its own website](http://www.thereasonforgod.com).

Quite frankly, I found _The Reason for God_ to be underwhelming. Keller spends the first half of the book responding to common objections to Christianity ("why is Christianity so exclusive?" "How can God send people to hell?", etc) and then takes the second half on the positive side of the bargain, explaining why he thinks Christianity is true, and then laying out a bit about Christian beliefs. While the reasoning was solid, it wasn't anything groundbreaking - it's the same stuff you'll find by reading C. S. Lewis' _The Abolition of Man_ and _Mere Christianity_ and N. T. Wright's _Simply Christian_. In fact, Keller quotes _extensively_ from Lewis and philosopher [Alvin Plantinga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga). Too often it seemed to me Keller should just be suggesting that we buy and read Lewis and Plantinga rather than reading his repackaged version.

The first half of the book kept my interest pretty well, but I will admit to a waning interest and a lot of skimming toward the end. This isn't to say that _The Reason for God_ is a bad book, or not worth reading. Put into the right hands, it could be a good introduction to the rational, logical reasons for Christianity. I don't think it'd answer all of the serious intellectual doubter's questions, but it'd be a start; good for your college seeker, too. But for someone who's already familiar with the arguments, has already read Lewis and the like? Don't bother. Or buy it for the quick read and then give it away. Here's hoping for something more fresh and insightful next time from the capable Dr. Keller.
