Yesterday was Day 2 of the RTCA committee meeting here in Augusta. (Why am I posting a day behind, you ask? Because there's free wi-fi in the convention center, but they want $10/day to get it in my room. I don't need it that bad... so I'm only online during the day.) The meetings were rather uneventful.

Traveled around Augusta last night, and was surprised a bit when I drove past the famed Augusta National golf club. For some reason when I picture golf courses I think of them as big, open, in beautiful surroundings. Augusta National (where they play the Masters every year) is plopped down right in the middle of an older, poor part of town. I suppose maybe years ago when they built it it was on the outskirts, but now it's just a walled-off enclave in the middle of the 'hood. Strange.

Last night I found a shopping mall (boring; all shopping malls are about the same. why do I continue to seek them out?), a bookstore (also the same, but good for buying gifts for the girls), and a steakhouse restaurant (mediocre at best - disappointing). But I spent most of my time at the restaurant and then in the hotel after dinner working through N. T. Wright's _Surprised by Hope_. There will be several blog posts on it here in the near future, but let me say right now that this is one of those books that has been an "aha" book for me. It simply makes sense and puts the pieces together in a way that no book has done for me since reading Lewis' _Mere Christianity_ and _The Abolition of Man_ back in college. Oh, and Dad, if you read this: I ordered you a copy this morning, so don't buy one.

Time for the meeting to start again. Gonna make sure those Synthetic Vision Systems are safe.
