Yeah, so my birthday isn't until Friday, but finalized plans yesterday to be able to not just attend the [Andrew Peterson](http://www.andrew-peterson.com) concert here in Cedar Rapids on Saturday, but also to be the runner for the day, which basically means just hanging out there at the church as they set up and then driving AP and company around anyplace they need to go. I was runner a couple years ago when AP and gang came for the Behold the Lamb of God tour, and it was a blast.

I was afraid it wasn't going to work out, mainly because I have been unable to find a replacement worship leader, so I still have to setup and then lead music for the 5:30 service at [Imago](http://www.imagochristicp.org). In stepped Becky, who awesomely volunteered to be the runner for me for a couple hours while I do the church service, then I can make it back just in time for the concert. Too much fun.

Andrew Peterson will be touring with Andy Gullahorn, Jill Phillips, Ben Shive, and maybe some others, and will be doing music from his upcoming album _Resurrection Letters, Vol. 2_. I'm listening to a few songs from it right now on a [Michael Card podcast](http://www.michaelcard.com/audio/radio/310.mp3) and there's some amazing new stuff. Saturday is going to be fun.
