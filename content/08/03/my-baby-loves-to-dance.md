As could only be written by the father of a little girl:

> My baby loves to dance, she loves to spin around She's only two feet tall but I don't mind at all She hears a song in every little sound.
> 
> My baby loves to move She settles on my chest She doesn't stay for long A moment, then she's gone She's off to find another heart to bless
> 
> And the leaves were turning gold and brown And people came from miles around To see her when she came to town
> 
> And then I turned and walked outside And stood beneath an autumn sky And felt a season falling And a new one taking flight
> 
> My baby loves me so She loves me as I am She lifts her little hands Her wish is my command I'll pick her up forever if I can.
> 
> \-- Andrew Peterson/Randall Goodgame, _My Baby Loves to Dance_, from _Slugs, Bugs, and Lullabies_
