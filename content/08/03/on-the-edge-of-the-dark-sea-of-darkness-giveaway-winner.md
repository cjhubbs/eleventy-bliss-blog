Apparently eleven of my readers were interested enough in getting a [free copy of Andrew Peterson's new book](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/03/18/on-the-edge-of-the-dark-sea-of-darkness/) that they left comments. I randomly chose one of the responses...

...and the winner is Bridget, one of my local readers. Congrats, Bridget! I'm sure Roy and Aaron will enjoy the book as well. :-)
