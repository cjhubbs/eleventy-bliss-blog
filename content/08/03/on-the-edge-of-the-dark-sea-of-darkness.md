_Read to the end of the blog post - I'm giving away a copy of the book!_

Just when you think you're familiar with a guy's talents... then _this_ happens.

I've been an Andrew Peterson fan for a few years now. He is an amazingly-talented songwriter; albums to his credit include my all-time favorite Christmas album, _Behold the Lamb of God_. He's shown himself to be a bit of a thinker and writer, too; he launched [The Rabbit Room](http://www.rabbitroom.com) a few months ago and it is now a must-read site with book and music reviews and essays on the arts and faith.

Then I hear the latest news: AP's writing a book. I actually think I got wind of it about 18 months ago from a friend who knows Andy, but had kinda forgotten about it. Now it's for real: [_On The Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400073847).

_OTEOTSDOD_ focuses on the quiet land of Skree, the Igiby children Janner, his younger brother Tink, and their crippled sister Leeli. Oh, and their ex-pirate (are you ever really an "ex"- pirate?) grandfather. There's something about lost jewels, and a dude whose name is Gnag the Nameless. (How is he nameless, again?) Oh, and there's this thing about toothy cows. Amazing.

_OTEOTSDOD_ is a work of fantasy and adventure. It feels a little bit like Narnia, but with much more humor and much less allegory. It feels a bit like Monty Python, but without all the naughty bits that you wouldn't want your kids to see. It feels a bit like _The Princess Bride_, but without Andre the Giant. And there are footnotes. Can't forget the footnotes.

Being over 30 I might not be in the target demographic for this book, but I loved it none the less. The cover of the book promises that this is just book one of the saga, and talking to Andrew before a concert the other night he confirmed he's working on the next volume. This is a set to add to your bookshelves. Fun to read, probably even more fun to read aloud - I just hope AP doesn't get so popular as an author that he stops making music.

Full disclosure: the publisher gave me a copy of this book to review. Can't say it influenced my review, though - the book really is good.

And now for the giveaway: they gave me an extra copy to giveaway. It's gonna be real simple: leave a comment in reply to this post anytime through March 19. I'll randomly select a winner and send you the copy.

Oh, if you don't win the giveaway, you can [buy the book from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400073847).
