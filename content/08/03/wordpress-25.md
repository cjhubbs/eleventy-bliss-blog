Just finished upgrading this blog to Wordpress 2.5. Easiest upgrade ever, since I migrated my install to use SVN last time. One little command, then run the upgrade script. Awesome.

So far, I like it - especially the option to automatically upgrade plugins. That's a time-saver, for sure. I'm not sure what happened, though - I reviewed some comments in moderation and approved a couple, yet they never showed up on the approved list. Maybe I just hit the wrong button? Dunno.
