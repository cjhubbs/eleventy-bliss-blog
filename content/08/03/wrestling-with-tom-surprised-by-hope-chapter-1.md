So it's been far too long since I posted [my original review](/08/03/wrestling-with-tom-an-american-evangelicals-coming-to-grips-with-n-t-wrights-surprised-by-hope/) of [Surprised by Hope](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0061551821%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0061551821%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02), the latest book from N. T. Wright. As you may recall from that review, I found myself stunned by the clarity and richness of Wright's exposition of the doctrines of heaven and the resurrection. (As Wright so cleverly puts it, "heaven is important, but it's not the end of the world!") Finally I'm finding some time to come back to it and interact more fully here. _Surprised by Hope_ is split into three broad sections: 'Setting the Scene', 'God's Future Plan', and 'Hope in Practice: Resurrection and the Mission of the Church'. In this post I want to just address the first chapter, titled 'All Dressed Up and No Place to Go'.

Wright opens _Surprised by Hope_ by positing two questions which he says are often dealt with quite separately but that should really be tied together.

> First, what is the ultimate Christian hope? Second, what hope is there for change, rescue, transformation, new possibilities within the world in the present? And the main answer can be put like this. As long as we see Christian hope in terms of "going to heaven," of a salvation that is essentially _away from_ this world, the two questions are bound to appear as unrelated. Indeed, some insist angrily that to ask the second one at all is to ignore the first one, which is the really important one. This in turn makes some others get angry when people talk of resurrection, as if this might draw attention away from the really important and pressing matters of contemporary social concern. But if the Christian hope is for _God's new creation_, for "new heavens and new earth", and if that hope has already come to life in Jesus of Nazareth, then there is every reason to join the two questions together.

Wright then goes on to highlight just a few of the various beliefs commonly held today regarding death and the afterlife. From the ancestor worship of Africans and Buddhists to the Islamic hope of paradise to the Jewish hope of resurrection, and finally to the Christian view... but what, exactly, _is_ the Christian view? Wright asserts that while there are many popular views of the afterlife in today's culture, "so far as I can tell, _most people don't know what orthodox Christian belief is._" Yes, there is some belief in "life after death", but what form does it take, and in what places? What about this word "resurrection"? Wright wants to clear up confusion on these issues.

It's hard to do much commentary on this first introductory chapter, but it certainly sets the scene for the book. More to come.
