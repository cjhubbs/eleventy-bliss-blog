So I'm rather a new-music junkie. Granted, it's gotta be in a genre I'm interested in, but hook me up with a new artist and I'll go whole hog. This week, on the recommendation of [Daniel](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/), I've been exploring the music of composer [Philip Glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass). I didn't know much about Philip Glass before this week; if you'd asked me I would have remembered that he was very into minimalism and possibly 12-tone music, but that's about it. I would've guessed that he's not my cup of tea whatsoever. But, having been promised that his newer works were more accessible, I decided to give it a shot.

My first stop: [Glass's personal website](http://www.philipglass.com/). It has a nice overview of his stuff and also... an [audio player](http://www.philipglass.com/audioplayer/audioplayer.html)! The player gives a pretty nice sampling of his stuff. It includes cuts from his music for the movie _The Hours_, which is beautiful stuff. It also has a sampling of his _Etudes for Piano_ which I found to be very nice. Then there's some weird stuff - for instance, the soundtrack for a very weird independent art film called _Koyaanisqatsi_. Definitely enough good stuff to get me interested, though.

My next stop: the local library. I currently have checked out to me nearly every Philip Glass CD that's in their system. While it's not an extensive collection, it's enough to get a sampling. There's the recording of his String Quartets - fairly nice. Then there's _Einstein on the Beach_, which is a whopping four (four!) CDs of "opera", though it's not like any opera you've ever heard or thought of. It's either brilliant or totally bizarre... maybe a bit of both. Following that I've been listening to his Symphony #4, _Heroes_. It, too, is pretty good. I still have _Dance Nos. 1 - 5_ and _music in twelve parts_ to sample, though I doubt I'm going to find them as enjoyable; I know from some online reading that _twelve parts_ is his serious work in the twelve-tone motif, which is too far down the esoteric path for me.

I still want to get my hands on _Symphony #1_, which Daniel highly recommended; the little samples on Amazonmp3.com sound good. Other than that, I feel like I've at least given Glass a good shot this week.

My conclusions: The soundtrack from _The Hours_ is a keeper and will get regular play time. The piano etudes probably will as well. Symphonies 1 and 4 are probably worth having and will get played semi-regularly. The older, more esoteric stuff is somewhat interesting, but probably not something that I'd listen to much. But hey, it's a new musical discovery, and one that found me some good new music, at that. Thanks, Daniel!
