There's been a good discussion going on over at The Rabbit Room regarding how Christians should deal with profanity and other sin portrayed in movies.

It started with [a thread where Andrew Peterson recommended the movie _Once_](http://www.rabbitroom.com/?p=593), but warned of "the F-bomb" being used 30 or so times. After that comment thread got interesting, he followed up with [a post titled "He Said A Wordy Dird"](http://www.rabbitroom.com/?p=600), where he explored his thoughts on the use of strong language. 46 comments, and good discussion that thread. Finally, Ron Block chimed in with [an excellent post](http://www.rabbitroom.com/?p=605) summarizing his views on how we approach art.

The discussion in the comment threads has been very good: respectful, thoughtful, and not without controversy. If you haven't yet checked out the Rabbit Room, go take a look. The topics aren't always this controversial, but the writing is good and the topics thoughtful.
