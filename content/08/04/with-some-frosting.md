One of the things that just fascinates me is observing the girls' learning - not just _what_ they learn but _how_ they learn. Sure, I'm a nerd, but thinking not just that "hey, she used a funny word" but realizing how that particular word reflects the fact that she's learning about verb tenses (without even knowing it!) just blows me away.

Recent highlight: Laura, looking at a book of nursery rhymes in the van yesterday on our way home from the mall. It's not a book we've read to her very many times. And she's not reading yet, so what she does is look at the pictures in the book, recite from memory as much as she can, and then improvise based on what she understands from the pictures. So Becky and I are sitting in the front seat talking, and soon we hear this:

"Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker man, bake me a cake as fast as you can. Pat it, and roll it, and mark it... um... with some frosting..."

Hilarity ensued.
