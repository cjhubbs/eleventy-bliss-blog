- It was an amazingly beautiful weekend. Fortunately the beautiful weather is sticking around for today so we can play softball.
- Oh, and I'm going to ump the second game of the night. I don't remember if I've said it before, but I enjoy umping games almost more than I enjoy playing them.
- Got a bunch of projects completed on the house this weekend.
- New carpet put down in basement: complete.
- Nasty mold scrubbed from laundry room wall: complete.
- Pegboard hung in laundry room to organize tools: complete.
- Tools organized: not so complete.
- Crock Pot cord repaired: complete.
- Music leading both Saturday night and Sunday morning: yep.
- Double-edged sword: if I had the Versus channel I could've watched the Dallas Stars play last night. On the other hand, had I stayed up to watch, I would've had to watch until the fourth OT to see them win.
- Go Stars! Bring on those Red Wings.
- If the Stars win the Stanley Cup this year I'm gonna buy that Mike Modano jersey I've always wanted.
- Enough with the bullets already.
