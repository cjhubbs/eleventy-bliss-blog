It's been a couple of weeks now but there was great excitement among the little girls in our house because we bought a nice set of bunk beds at a garage sale and set them up in Laura's room. Laura is now the proud owner of a "big bed" - a real twin-sized bed with real sheets and pillow. We've set up the upper bunk as well (the pictures were taken before it got set up) and while we don't have any immediate plans to move Addie in with Laura, I imagine it'll happen eventually.

So it's time for some before-and-after pictures, well, of a sort. Back in November 2005 when Laura was 16 months old and we knew that Addie was on the way, we set up a new crib for Laura and she wanted to help assemble it. This was the scene:

Fast-forward to May 2008 and Daddy now has two little helpers.

And the finished result:
