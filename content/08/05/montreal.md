So today was the day I finally ventured outside the good 'ol US of A; traveling to Montreal, Quebec for the next round of SC-213 meetings. No big details, pictures, or etc so far, but it was nice to actually have decent travel this time around. The flights were more or less on time, the lines were short, the rental car big enough (the PT Cruiser has an amazing amount of leg and head room!) and the hotel comfortable.

Now it's just after midnight and I'm sitting up too late working on an andrewosenga.net redesign. I finally got the layout working more or less how I want it... now it's time to make it pretty. Well... that can wait until tomorrow.
