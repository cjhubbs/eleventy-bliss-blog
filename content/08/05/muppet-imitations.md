Apparently this is something that goes by generations, too. I've done Kermit (among others) for a long time... (including on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAa8zmAe2dI)... [twice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYsZuNYgxGY)) and now the girls are up to it, too.

Today I decided to wear my Beaker t-shirt. No sooner did I come home this morning (Becky's not feeling well) than they both pointed at the shirt and asked, "Who's that guy?" So here they are, doing their best Beaker impressions.

For reference, the t-shirt:
