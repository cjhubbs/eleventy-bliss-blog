I have a couple other posts floating around in my head, but need to gather some thoughts (and pictures) before writing them. So... a little this'n'that, aka bullet points for a Tuesday morning.

- Softball last night was fantastic. Beautiful weather, good competitive game. Oh, and we won.
- Not my favorite: opposing pitchers who whine about us taking walks when they are unable to throw a strike.
- Definitely my favorite: Becky, who struck out (looking!) said whiny pitcher to start the seventh inning.
- My list of projects is getting long. I've accomplished some, but others are going to slide right into June without me even touching them. :-(
- Next week: headed to Montreal. Looking forward to it.
- Also next week: Becky's folks come to visit. This will be two years in a row that they've come to visit the week that I've been on travel. Hmmm... wonder what I should infer from that?
- These [Fractal Drawers](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/12/fractal-drawers.html) might be one of the coolest things I've ever seen... at least this week. (Saw them on Boing Boing, then [Daniel](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/) shared them, too... thanks Dan!)
