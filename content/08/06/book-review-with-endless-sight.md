_Back when I reviewed Andrew Peterson's book on this blog, the publisher, Multnomah Books, asked if I'd be interested in reviewing others on the blog, and I said yes. I wasn't interested in reading this one, but Becky was, so she did. She was planning on writing a review this week, but with the flood situation, she hasn't had time. I'm going to post the publisher-provided summary instead._

Belleville, Illinois and Wyoming Territories, 1861[![](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image001.jpg "image001")](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image001.jpg)

Born into a life of privilege, fourteen-year-old Belinda never questions her security, even as she leaves Illinois with her family to discover new adventures in the Oregon Territory. But when disaster falls, Belinda is left wounded, weak, and alone. Her faith in God gives her the only strength she knows in a harsh new world.

Belindaâ€™s journey takes her to a snow-covered mining camp and a red-roofed brothel in the Wyoming mountains, but not before she must spend a lonely winter with the man who took away the life she knew. Throughout the grief and hope of a strange land, Belinda must decide if her faith is big enough to allow her to forgive.

The satisfying conclusion to the Crossroads of Grace series, With Endless Sight offers a rich story of family, new beginnings, and the freedom that grace can bring.
