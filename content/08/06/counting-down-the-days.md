Once today is complete I will have only 6 more working days until vacation... and oh my, am I ever looking forward to it. My brother Andrew is getting married on July 12 and we are using that as an excuse to take a week's vacation to Washington. (The state, not the district.) We have several days of sightseeing and relaxation scheduled around the wedding, and it should be a great time. We'll hit Seattle, the Pacific coast, the mountains, and back to Seattle before heading home.

Preparations have been in a lull for a while - there was the frenzy months ago when we purchased our airline tickets, made hotel reservations, etc, but then we put it aside and it's just been lurking... and now we are back to planning in earnest. At this point Becky is starting to figure out what all needs to be brought along, how we can fit it into as few bags as possible, and so on.

I'll admit it - the one thing I'm nervous/fearful of on this trip is the airline travel. We're taking the girls on their first airplane trip, which will be fun, and we've planned in longish layovers, to try to ensure things go smoothly... but it's still a cross-country airline trip, and we're still connecting through Chicago O'Hare. I will be praying much that things just go smoothly. Once we're in Seattle with our rental car and all our baggage, the next week should be just brilliant fun.

So that's my little update for today. I'll try for a more substantive post tomorrow as a major milestone occurs in the Hubbs household.
