Some of my regular readers will remember that from time to time I'll have link posts that will show up here; interesting things I've noted on the web and wanted to share. I've been notably inconsistent with that type of post, but still link some stuff from time to time. I was surprised, then, when after posting a couple of links yesterday to [my del.icio.us account](http://del.icio.us/hubbsc), they didn't show up here overnight. Come to find out that the del.icio.us service that cross-posts apparently hasn't run since March sometime. Phooey.

So I've been using Google Reader as my usual feed reader and it has a nifty little interface to share items which will then show up for any other Google Reader user who's one of my contacts, or anybody who wants to subscribe to the shared items feed. What GR doesn't provide is a similar sort of remote-posting functionality. What GR _does_ provide is a little bit of javascript that will pull in the most recent shared items and list them. So, for the moment I've put that on my sidebar. The obvious downside is that anyone who just reads my items from a feed reader won't be able to see them. (On the other hand, those folks could easily enough subscribe to [my Google Reader Shared Items feed](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/06114037049174756657).)

If and when I find a better way to do this link sharing, I'll do so. For now, hey, I suppose anything is better than nothing.
