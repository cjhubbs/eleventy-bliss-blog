No time to post pictures but if you visit any online news site you'll undoubtedly be able to see the pictures of Cedar Rapids, IA. When the river crests tomorrow (God willing), it will be about 12 feet above, not flood stage, but 12 feet above the previously-highest measured flood. Twenty feet above flood stage.

We are on high ground here in Hiawatha, but very wet, saturated ground. The water started coming up through the cracks in the basement floor about 1 pm on Thursday, and we've been running two Shop Vacs non-stop since then (14 hours now). We're keeping up with it, but only just. It hasn't rained for almost seven hours now, so I keep thinking (hoping) that the water level will go down enough that it'll stay out of the basement. I guess we'll find out. For now, we're just praying for no more rain and for these shop vacs to hold out. I doubt they were designed to run this long this hard.

We have an internet connection finally here at home (it was out for 24 hours due to the flooding), so I'll try to post updates if I get a chance.
