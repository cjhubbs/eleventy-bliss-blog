It's starting to hit home that one week from now we will be on an airplane, with the kiddos, headed for our Washington vacation and Andrew's wedding. We've gotten to the list-making stage. What all do we need to take? What will the weather be like? (It's a lot different on the coast than it is in Leavenworth where the wedding will be!) What suitcases are we taking along? How many bags will we have to check? Do we have seats assigned on all the flights? And on and on and on.

For me, the most stressful part of the trip is from now until we are at Seatac with a rental car and all our bags. After that, it's all downhill. I don't think it's really gonna be as bad as I'm worried it will be... but I can be a good worrier. I'm really looking forward to this vacation, though - both for Andrew & Heather's wedding and just for the chance to get away - almost 2 full weeks away from the office once you count the holiday this week and then our trip. It'll be so nice.

Stay focused, Chris... still three more days of work.
