I had three things on my to-do list for the weekend as of last Friday afternoon. And though I kept busy all weekend, those three things are still on my to-do list. How did that happen? I suppose I could do like Becky does and add items to my to-do list after I've done them just so I can cross them off. But when you use an on-line list that removes completed items from view, there's not a lot of satisfaction in it.

Still, I managed to get a bunch of stuff done around the house: mowed the lawn, cleaned out the gutters and installed some gutter guard, did the dishes (well, at least unloaded and loaded the dishwasher). Led music for both Saturday night and Sunday morning church services. Took the girls to the park to play in the splash pad. Laura, who last year was too scared of the water to even want to get wet, was running through the sprayers yesterday with great enthusiasm. I foresee many trips to the park this summer.

And now it's Monday again. I guess I'll be hitting 'postpone' on those tasks a few more times.
