Well, I haven't done a meme in a while, and [Jeff tagged me for this one](http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2008/06/18/top-ten-movies/), so I'll give it a go.

The rules of the “game” are simple: 1. list your top ten favorite films (in no particular order). 2. if you’re tagged, you’ve got to post and tag 3-5 other people. 3. give a tag back (some link love) to the one who tagged you in your post 4. give a hat tip (HT) to Dan (I have no idea who Dan is, but hey, there ya go).

This is gonna be a challenge for me, because I haven't watched that many movies lately, and really, how do you go about choosing favorites? Simply by number of times watched? At least you'll get 10 from me here that I really like. Maybe not the 10 greatest movies I've ever seen, but 10 that I'd be happy to sit down and watch again semi-regularly or would recommend to a friend. Oh, and off the top, I'm not gonna say Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, because they're almost prerequisites for this kind of list, and it seems boring. So, in no particular order...

1\. The Princess Bride An oldie but goodie. Yes, I can quote far too much of it. But to leave it off the list would be, well, inconceivable. And how can you dislike a movie with Andre the Giant?

2\. Lost in Translation Bill Murray. So good. Scarlett Johannson. Amazing. Slow, light on plot, heavy on atmosphere. I loved it.

3\. That Thing You Do So I'm a sucker for a movie about musicians who briefly make the bigtime. Tom Hanks is such a fantastic character in this movie, and yeah, if I'm one of the guys in the film, hands down, I'm the drummer.

4\. Fiddler on the Roof I really need to include a musical on here somewhere, and Fiddler is a great musical. It's been far too long since I've watched this one. But Topol captures Tevye so well, and the songs are classics.

5\. Once OK, so I'm gonna include a second musical on here, and it's gonna be a film that I've only seen, well, once. Low-budget, first-time actors, but the story feels _real_ in a way that very few films seem to manage. I need to buy this one.

6\. Apollo 13 Jeff mentioned this one in his list, but I'm gonna include it here, too. Sure, Tom Hanks is great in the starring role, but Ed Harris is the guy that makes the movie for me. And how can I not love a movie where the true heroes are nerdy engineers? Can _you_ build a CO2 scrubber from this random assortment of parts?

7\. Heat Michael Mann at his best, and Pacino and DeNiro to boot. A big crime drama, spread across Southern California, with the atmosphere and expanse that Mann seems to do so well. Oh, and did I mention Pacino and DeNiro?

8\. The Matrix Can we just forget that this is supposedly the beginning of a movie trilogy? This movie works so well by itself - the cyberpunk genre, the stop-action camera work, the ridiculous action scenes... so much fun.

9\. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Too many of the old song-and-dance movies were very weakly plotted, with just enough plot to string things together between musical numbers. Mitty isn't one of those. Yes, it provides ample opportunity for Danny Kaye to mug for the camera, do some hilarious song-and-dance routines (how can you not love Anatole of Paris?), and generally cut up, but they actually belong as part of the plot. Lots of fun.

10\. L.A. Confidential It was harder than I thought coming up with a tenth film, but this one deserves a spot here. A gritty film noir filled with all the elements you could want - dirty cops, femme fatales, Hollywoord in its heyday. Add in Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and James Cromwell, and you've got a great film.

Now, then, who to tag? [Rae](http://www.raewhitlock.com). [CanaDan](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/). [Bridget](http://mrsxb.blogspot.com).
