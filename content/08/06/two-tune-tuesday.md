Tomorrow is June 17, 2008. Tomorrow, two records that I have long anticipated will be released and find their way into my hands: [Coldplay's](http://www.coldplay.com) _Viva la Vida, or Death and all His Friends_, and [Ben Shive's](http://www.benshive.com) _The Ill-Tempered Klavier_. An odd pairing, you ask? Not so fast. Let's compare for a minute.

**Coldplay**: has a drummer named [Will](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Champion). **Ben Shive**: [has played on a record with](http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7414399) a drummer named Will.

**Coldplay**: Lead singer Chris Martin has children with unusual Biblical names like Apple and Moses. **Ben Shive**: Has children with unusual Biblical names like Ezra and Jude.

**Coldplay**: Lots of piano-driven songs. **Ben Shive**: The dude was born with a piano already attached to his fingers.

**Coldplay**: Song on first record called _Daylight_ **Ben Shive**: Song on first record called _She Is The Rising Sun_.

**Coldplay**: Two band members had cameos in the movie _Shaun of the Dead_ **Ben Shive**: Has appearances in many Andy Gullahorn-directed short films.

**Coldplay**: New record available for $10 tomorrow at Best Buy and Target. **Ben Shive**: New record available for $10 tomorrow at the [Rabbit Room Store](http://store.rabbitroom.com).

Eerie how the similarities stack up, isn't it?

The bigger question to me is this: a year from now, which one of these records will have gotten more play on my iPod? If I were to hazard a guess... it won't be the band with the leader who shares my name and birth month; it'll be the guy with whom I went to Best Buy last time he was in town. Guess we'll find out.
