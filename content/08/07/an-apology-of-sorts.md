I had really intended to keep the blog up-to-date while on this vacation - after all, during the vacation I have even more to write about than I would otherwise. Sadly, though... well, maybe not so sadly, I've been vacationing rather than blogging. :-) I have been taking lots of pictures, though, so they'll show up eventually, along with some thoughts.

Short summary, though: Andrew and Heather were married yesterday evening in a beautiful outdoor ceremony. The weather was fantastic, everything was well-organized and -executed, and the party afterward was a lot of fun. Now it's Sunday morning and all of us who remain here are more than a little tired... but it was quite worth it.

More later, I promise.
