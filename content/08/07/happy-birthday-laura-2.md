Our oldest daughter Laura turns 4 today. So far she's celebrated the morning with a bowl of Rice Krispies and a new Veggie Tales DVD. She's quite excited about it. :-)

Here's a little photo retrospective:

Laura, almost 4, at Andrew's wedding a couple weeks ago: [![DSC_7113](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3281/2706866316_a277c4604c.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/2706866316/ 'DSC_7113 by chrishubbs, on Flickr')

She is turning into quite a young lady... time just flies. We are so blessed to have a sweet girl who loves her family and loves Jesus. Happy birthday, Laura!
