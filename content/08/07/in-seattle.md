Day 1 of our vacation finally brings us to Seattle. Our flights were only delayed a little - we arrived at SEA maybe 30 minutes after our scheduled arrival time. Our luggage came through intact. (Had we known that the minivan we are renting had built-in child seats, we could've saved ourselves one piece of luggage... but ah well.)

The girls handled the trip wonderfully. Addie was mostly excited about seeing all the airplanes - her little nose was pasted to the window as much as possible, though she had to be up on her knees to see out the plane window - she's too short to see out otherwise! Laura's greatest excitement came from seeing the mountains out the airplane window. She's never been to the mountains before, and when she saw the snowcaps, she let out a loud whoop, and kept yelling "Mountains, Mommy, mountains!"

We got in our aforementioned minivan and headed the few miles to our hotel. I was thinking the van felt a little funny but wasn't quite sure. When we got to the hotel, it was definitely feeling funny... and yep, there was a flat tire on the back. Ugh. As frustrating as it was to have rented a vehicle with a flat right off the lot, I must say that Alamo handled it pretty well - I called the local rental place, they told me that it'd be no charge since it was right off the lot, they forwarded me to roadside assistance who had somebody at my location within 45 minutes to put on the spare. Then I drove the van on the donut spare back to SEATAC to exchange it for a different van. That was an hour and a half I would have preferred not to waste, but hey, it's done now.

Tomorrow we're headed down to spend a couple days on the coast. Can't wait.
