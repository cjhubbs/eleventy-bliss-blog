After [arriving late on Monday](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/07/08/in-seattle/) and [having vehicle difficulty](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/07/09/the-flat-tire/), we took the new minivan out to the Washington coast to spend a couple of days at the beach. We encountered several of these signs along the way... not something we typically see back home in Iowa.

The three-hour drive to the appropriately-named Long Beach brought us from temperatures in the upper 70's in the Seattle area to 60 degrees, fog, and 30 mph winds in Long Beach. Yowza! We were glad we had remembered to pack jackets. We stayed at the [Lighthouse Oceanfront Resort](http://www.lighthouseresort.net) as part of a little deal where I created them a new website. We had a two-bedroom condo that, when the fog was out, provided us a view of the Pacific from our deck. The girls had much fun on the beach even in the cold; Laura found a real live clam, which stayed real and live until it had set in our minivan for a day, at which point it became real and very ripe. To spend actual time _in_ the water, though, we enjoyed the heated pool at the resort.

The second day we ventured out to check out one of the nearby lighthouses. We tried to figure out how to reach the lighthouse on Cape Disappointment, but couldn't figure out which road to take. So instead we visited the [North Head Lighthouse](http://www.funbeach.com/attractions/lighthouse-northhead.html), and while we couldn't tour it (no children under 7 allowed on the tour), we still had a nice little walk and got some nice pictures of the lighthouse and the coast. Apparently the North Head Lighthouse records some of the strongest winds along the Pacific coast. We didn't quite blow away, but it was seriously breezy.

Having traveled to the coast, the one thing Becky really wanted to eat was seafood. We did a little research and tried out a couple of different places that appeared to be somewhat family-friendly and within our budget. My conclusion is that seafood places in tourist towns must plan to sell you overpriced seafood and then make up for it with terrible service. The first night we tried a place called [Doogers](http://www.doogersseafoodandgrill.com/), and while my food was decent, the server totally forgot to bring me the Diet Pepsi I ordered. Becky's combination platter was completely missing one of its major elements, a fact which wasn't brought to light until Becky decided to ask for help identifying each of the elements on the platter. They went ahead and cooked up a razor clam and brought it out to her at the end of the meal, but still, come on, folks. The second night we tried The Crab Pot, supposedly a local favorite since 1946. We thought that surely it would be an improvement over Doogers. No such luck. Higher prices, poorer food, and incredibly awful service.

Still, though, we found a local bakery that was fantastic, and overall very much enjoyed ourselves in Long Beach. It would have been fun to have another day to spend traipsing around, but our schedule called us to move on. Next up: Yakima, en route to Leavenworth.

Note: I'm putting all the pics from the trip in [this set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157606017422974/). There are far more than what I'm going to post on the blog. Grandparents will want to visit the link to see all the pics. :-)
