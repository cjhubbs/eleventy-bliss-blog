After the beach we took a couple of days to travel up from Long Beach to Leavenworth. The stop in Yakima wasn't really anything to write home about - Yakima is quite different from the other places in Washington we visited - dry, dusty, more desert than anything. But it was a good stopping-off point. Becky shot pictures from the moving van like a wild woman. She did get a rather nice one of Mount Rainier:

Also, on our way up to Leavenworth, the girls had fun throwing rocks into this little mountain stream:

Once we made it to Leavenworth, we had a great time with family and friends at the wedding. We stayed at the [Riverdance Lodge](http://www.riverdanceleavenworth.com), which you really must check out via their website to appreciate. It's a ridiculously posh vacation home which happens to be right next door to the house that Andrew & Heather were borrowing for the wedding. So, our family rented it to stay for a couple days. Fantastic choice.

I've got a [whole set of photos on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157606175171898/) from the rehearsal and before and after the wedding, and it's really hard to decide which ones to show here, so I'll just give you one of them and you can go visit the set. In this particular pic, Andrew and Heather were kinda bored during the photo shoot and gave me this little pose:

Such fun. There's one more I'd post, but somehow I didn't get it uploaded to Flickr yet. I'll make a separate post for that one picture - how often can you say you have a guy relieving himself against a tree in the background of a wedding picture? :-)

The wedding was beautiful and went about as smoothly as any wedding I've ever been to. I played the piano, Ryan sang, Laura and Addie were beautiful flower girls. They also had a lot of fun dancing afterwards. What a fantastic time of celebration.
