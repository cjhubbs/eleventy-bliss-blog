_Wild Goose Chase_, the latest book by pastor Mark Batterson of National Community Church in Washington, DC, sets out its' premise in the introduction:

> The Celtic Christians had a name for the Holy Spirit that has always intrigued me. They called Him _An Geadh-Glas_, or "the Wild Goose". I love the imagery and implications. The name hints at the mysterious nature of the Holy Spirit. Much like a gild goose, the Spirit of God cannot be tracked or tamed. An element of danger and an air of unpredictability surround Him. And while the name may sound a little sacrilegious at first earshot, I cannot think of a better description of what it's like to pursue the Spirit's leading through life than _Wild Goose chase_. I think the Celtic Christians were on to something that institutionalized Christianity has missed out on...

With each chapter in the book, Batterson then calls the reader to "come out of the cage" of one encumbrance or another, sharing anecdotes from his own life and those he's come into contact with in his ministry, and then finishing up each chapter with an example of the principle that he sees in the life of a biblical character.

I was unimpressed when the introduction, and indeed, the whole premise of the book, seemed to be based less on some Scriptural principle than on a single phrase from Christian antiquity. And my concerns were deepened when I looked at the chapter titles and subheadings:

- Goose Bumps: Coming Out of the Cage of Responsibility
- Dictatorship Of The Ordinary: Coming Out of the Cage of Routine
- Eight-Foot Ceilings: Coming Out of the Cage of Assumptions
- A Rooster's Crow: Coming Out of the Cage of Guilt
- Sometimes it Takes A Shipwreck: Coming Out of the Cage of Failure
- Good Old-Fashioned Guts: Coming Out of the Cage of Fear

While there are some good points to be made in the book from time to time, it really feels to me that Batterson wrote the self-help, motivational principles of _Wild Goose Chase_ and then looked to find bits and pieces of Scripture to support his points... which is a dangerous way to teach the Bible. In addition, Batterson's style of writing is unimaginative, clich√©-ridden, trying too hard to be cool and trendy. Color me unimpressed.

After finishing up _Wild Goose Chase_, I felt like I had just sat through one of those exercise infomercials where ridiculously-toned models and cheesy announcers hype their transform-your-life product _ad nauseam_ for 30 minutes late at night. What I came away longing for was something more solid, stable, and reliable - something more analogous to a Ken Burns documentary on PBS. So I'm sorry, Multnomah, I just can't recommend this book. My friends, if you're going to buy a book on living the Christian life, get something by Eugene Peterson instead. You'll be glad you did.

_As requested, I'll link to Amazon: you can buy_ [Wild Goose Chase](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590527194) _there. But I'd suggest you pick up something else instead._
