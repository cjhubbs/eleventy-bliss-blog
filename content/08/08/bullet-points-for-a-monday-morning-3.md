A week without a blog update + lack of creativity = desperate measures. Hence, the bullet points.

- This past weekend felt far more like autumn than summer; this morning when I woke up it was 53°F outside and 63°F in the house. Beautiful sleeping weather. It's gonna warm up a bit this week, but nothing too bad.
- I _thought_ it felt like I ran into a strand of web as I walked into the dining room this morning. A few minutes later I felt something on my neck. Becky, you can thank me later for killing that spider. :-)
- My sermon on Saturday night went pretty well. I intended to link to it here but didn't get it uploaded last night. It'll have to wait.
- Now I need to get my backside in gear for my next sermon, only two weeks hence. How do I focus all I want to say about worship into 30 minutes?
- Next week I'm headed to Denver for some training and a conference. I think it'll probably be warmer in Denver than it will be at home while I'm gone.
- Nick & Allie led worship Saturday night at Imago and did a fantastic job. Allie wrote a new tune for the hymn _Under His Wings_ that has been stuck in my head all weekend. Thanks a lot, Allie. ;-)
- My poor backyard is being overtaken by crabgrass. Gotta do something about that.

Well, now, that was random, eh?
