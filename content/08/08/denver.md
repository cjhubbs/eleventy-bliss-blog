OK, so bad travel plans notwithstanding, I made it to Denver on-time on Monday evening. Tuesday was spent in an all-day FAA DER Recurrent General Training class (boring), and today and Thursday I'm attending the National Software and Airborne Electronic Hardware Conference. It's sponsored by the FAA and NASA Langley Research Center, and there are some really interesting topics if you're into safety-critical airborne software. Which, I know, none of you reading this are. :-) So enough about the conference.

Haven't really seen much of Denver yet, though I may atone for that this evening and travel about. I've just got too many things on my to-do list for this week. Sermon prep for Saturday, new Conversation Cafe website (now branded [Topics On First](http://www.topicsonfirst.org) - check it out! - but it's still the beta version of the site), planning orders of service for the fall, updating church bylaws and membership covenants... so much to do, so little time.

Denver is a little bit frustrating, location-wise, because you think you're in Colorado, there should be mountains... but there aren't really any mountains in Denver. You can see them off in the distance, but they're still too far away to get to without some more serious time driving than I'll have. Oh well. Maybe one of these summers we can hit them for a vacation again.

Well, lunch hour is almost over so it's time to head back to the conference. Good times.
