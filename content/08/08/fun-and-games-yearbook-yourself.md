If you're looking for a little bit of amusement you could do worse than checking out [YearbookYourself.com](http://www.yearbookyourself.com). It is pretty much what it sounds like it is - you upload a picture of yourself and it gives you some idea of what your highschool yearbook photos might have looked like any year from the 1950's through the 1990's. I had a little bit of fun this afternoon.

For reference, here's the picture I gave it to work with:

Here's my 1962 yearbook photo. My face is a little oversized in this one, it didn't work quite as well as I'd hoped. ![](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/1962_small.jpg "1962_small")

Here's 1968. ![](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/1968_small.jpg "1968_small")

Here's 1970. This is definitely my favorite. ![](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/1970_small.jpg "1970_small")

Most of the rest of the 70's didn't work out too well because of the hair it tried to put on me. So, we fast-forward to 1984. Now, this hair isn't that great, either. ![](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/1984_small.jpg "1984_small")

By the time we get to 1988, it starts to get to something almost believable... ![](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/1988_small.jpg "1988_small")

And then here's 1994. I started my senior year of high school in 1994. The scary part: I had one of those cardigans, and I loved it. ![](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/1994_small.jpg "1994_small")
