Work necessitates that tomorrow I travel from Cedar Rapids to Denver to attend three days of FAA training. On the face of it, that doesn't sound too bad, travel-wise. CID -> DEN is only a two-hour flight, and one US airline, when not eternally funding the estate of George Gershwin with its advertising budget, provides three daily non-stop flights from our fair city to the Mile-High.

But wait! This is no ordinary travel planning. This is corporate travel! Per the guidelines of our corporate travel policy (its wisdom, who can measure?) I have been routed on a different airline from Cedar Rapids first to Dallas-Fort Worth, and only _then_ to Denver. For those scoring along at home, that's 850 miles and two hours south-by-southwest to DFW, a 90-minute layover, then another 800 miles and two hours northwest from DFW to DEN. Which is quite obviously far superior to the 700 miles and two hours directly west from CID to DEN. To ice the proverbial cake, the forecast for both CID and DEN tomorrow calls for nothing but sunshine. DFW? 80% probability of thunderstorms.

[Two years ago](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/06/28/atlanta-impressions/) when I attended this training travel was a mess and I ended up driving through downtown Atlanta at midnight searching for my hotel; [last year DFW gave me delays heading to New Orleans](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2007/07/24/new-orleans-faa-sw-der-conference/) and I was trying to avoid the bayou and find my hotel after even The Big Easy had fallen asleep. Even with this year's circuitous routing I am scheduled to arrive in Denver before 7 pm MDT, so it will take some serious delays if I am to achieve the three-peat. Still, with travel plans like this, anything is possible.
