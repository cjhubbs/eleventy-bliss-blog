One of the things we've been wrestling with as elders at Imago is the concept of church membership. Now, we all agree that membership is important, both for accountability for folks who are a part of the fellowship, and to provide accountability for the church leadership. But most of us come from Baptist churches where "membership" is too often considered a ticket to gripe and cause trouble at business meetings.

Our objectives for "membership" and the "membership process":

1. Provide a way for people to feel like they are a part of the congregation
2. Provide a process whereby people can understand Imago's distinctives, including doctrinal statement and leadership structure
3. Create an environment where people come to think of "membership" as having responsibilities and commitments rather than "privileges"
4. Keep the voting base limited to the core planning/leadership team, rather than the standard Baptist congregational democracy.
5. Oh, yeah, and the end result needs to be church members, committed to service and under the authority of the church.

We have pretty well settled on a set of three "covenants" that might be looked at as "tiers" of membership, though we're trying hard not to call them that.

**Fellowship Covenant**

- I will support the ministry of Imago Christi Church with my regular attendance at worship services and other events sponsored by the church.

This one is pretty basic. This allows people who want to feel like they're a part of a fellowship to say that yeah, they're a part of the fellowship. I have really wrestled with whether or not this covenant should include a statement of accountability to the church. I am thinking maybe it should.

**Ministry Covenant**

- I will support the ministry of Imago Christi Church with my regular attendance at worship services and other events sponsored by the church.
- I will support the church with its financial needs as the Lord so directs me.
- I will use my spiritual gifts in ministry opportunities of the church.
- I will become better acquainted with ministry opportunities and strategies by attending planning and evaluation meetings of the church. I understand that I am able to contribute to the discussion at these meetings, but do not have the right to vote.
- I will submit myself by being accountable to the leadership of Imago Christi Church.

Part of the commitment at this level would require completion of a membership class, which would include a review of the doctrinal statement. At this level we wouldn't require that the person agree with the doctrinal statement 100%, but we'd ask them to identify any differences they have and discuss them with the elders.

People committed at this level would be able to assume responsibilities such as teaching children, assisting in (but not leading) ministries, and would be welcome to participate in business and planning meetings of the church, but would not have a vote.

**Leadership Covenant**

- I will support the ministry of Imago Christi Church with my regular attendance at worship services and other events sponsored by the church.
- I will support the church with its financial needs as the Lord so directs me.
- I will use my spiritual gifts in ministry opportunities of the church.
- I will attend and participate in the discussion at planning and evaluation meetings of the church and have the right to vote on any church business as prescribed by the church bylaws.
- I will submit myself by being accountable to the leadership of Imago Christi Church.

At this level, we would require that folks agree with our doctrinal statement, have been baptized by immersion, and have completed the membership class. This level would also require the approval of the elders.

We're still not sure when we'll institute this process - I'm guessing probably in January. A year is plenty long for us to run with no members.
