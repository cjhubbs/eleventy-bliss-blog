Well, the girls know now, so it won't be long before the rest of the world does. :-)

It seems that the Lord has seen fit to bless us with another little Hubbs kid. No word as to whether Laura and Addie will have a little brother or sister (and we probably won't find out before hand), but, Lord willing, we will welcome child number three sometime near the end of March next year.

Time to start practicing the zone defense.
