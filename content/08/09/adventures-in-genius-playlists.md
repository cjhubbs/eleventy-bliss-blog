I've quite enjoyed playing with the new Genius playlist feature in iTunes 8.0, but found out yesterday that it makes some interesting choices when it's limited by the subset of music I have on my 8GB iPod touch.

(To make sense of this for my mom and others who might read this who have no idea what the Genius playlist is - basically you give it one song, and it generates a playlist of "similar" songs from whatever you have on your iPod. It works really well with my full music library.)

Case in point: I asked it to generate a 25-song playlist based on Simon and Garfunkel's classic _Mrs. Robinson_.

Near the middle of the playlist: John Williams' _Imperial March_ from _The Empire Strikes Back_.

I don't even wanna know how it made that leap. (Well, I sorta do.... but not really... but yeah.)
