After making the decision to leave [Imago Christi](http://www.imagochristicp.org) at the end of the month, we find ourselves in an unfamiliar position: starting the church search. My church history is fairly short and doesn't include much searching: while growing up we attended a C&MA church, a small Berean church, and then a [small Bible church](http://www.gracebiblegranbury.com). When I went to college I floated around for my first semester until Becky invited me to her [medium-sized Bible church](http://www.longviewfbc.com), which we then attended for the next 3.5 years. When we moved to Iowa, we were recommended to a church up here, and after about three weeks of visiting other churches decided to stick there where we had been recommended, at [Noelridge](http://www.noelridge.org). We were at Noelridge for 8.5 years before leaving to plant Imago, and we were at Imago for the better part of a year. So my total church searching experience is a few months of aimless wandering in college and a few weeks after moving to Iowa. That ain't much.

Church searching has changed a lot since 9 years ago when we were looking around here in Cedar Rapids. Back then your main resources were the yellow pages and the religion section of the newspaper. Today, though, it's all about the websites. You can find out a lot about a church's beliefs and ministries with just a few clicks of the mouse. You can even listen to recent sermons. I think I'll have to be careful not to do _too much_ pre-judging by the websites.

Several things I am anticipating will make this church search tough:

- **Theological pickiness**. I don't expect that I'm gonna agree with _everything_ at any church I attend, (heck, I didn't at Noelridge or Imago, either), but I'd like it to be close. And I'll need to have the freedom at a church to hold some views that don't quite line up and not be ostracized for those. For example: [one of the churches we've been considering](http://www.cedarvalley.org) has a [rather long excursis](http://www.cedarvalley.org/doctrinalstatement/futuredoctrine.shtml) in their doctrinal statement concerning the exact sequence of a premillenial end times. I'm OK with them believing that, but I won't be able to handle it if they're dogmatic about it.
- **Leadership Expectations**. Now, I have no desire to be in leadership again for a while. But I'm going to want to have the pastor and elders of a church I attend be men who enjoy reading and discussing theological topics. I almost feel sorry for the pastor and/or elders who will have the typical so-you're-interested-in-our-church meeting with me. I have a feeling I'll have far more questions for them than they will have for me. Bonus points for anybody that's read any N. T. Wright. :-)
- **Limited Choices**. Now, while some of my friends will step in and suggest a bigger denominational change, I just can't see us moving to a more mainline denomination, even a conservative branch of one. We're not gonna end up Catholic, Lutheran, or Methodist, and we don't even have conservative Anglican or Presbyterian options in Cedar Rapids. Which pretty well leaves us Baptist, Bible, maybe E Free, and, well, not much else. Even in as big a town as Cedar Rapids. :-(
- **The Struggle for Contentment**. I am acknowledging here up front that we may not find someplace that I'm completely happy with. And that will have to be OK. I would dearly love to have [Steve McCoy's](http://www.stevekmccoy.com) church or [Joe Thorn](http://www.joethorn.net)'s church or [Rae Whitlock](http://www.raewhitlock.com)'s church nearby. I would totally go for an Acts29 church, and would take a very long hard look at one of the new breed of PCA churches. (We have [one PCA church here](http://www.hope-presbyterian.org/) about 30 minutes away, and it appears to be the old, stodgy flavor of the PCA.) But given that those aren't available, we will have to be content with what we have available here. We're praying that God will be clear in His leading.

We get a pass this weekend - we're leaving in a couple of hours to head to Wisconsin to visit my folks. But next weekend we'll have to bite the bullet, pick one of our options, and give it a try. I'm planning on blogging our adventures, so check back. If you've got any thoughts or suggestions, feel free to leave them in the comments.
