OK, so I'm biased a little bit. I really like Andy Osenga's music. I run his fan website. I drive for hours to see the guy play shows. But all that aside, yesterday Andy put out _Letters to the Editor, Vol. 2_, and it's definitely worth a listen. Or multiple listens.

As the "Vol. 2" would indicate, this is the second in what I hope will be a long-running series of EPs from Andy based on inspiration sent in by his fans. His fans are all over this album, really - in addition to the song ideas, they submitted pictures, which he uses in an extensive "album liner" PDF file, and recorded "Webground" vocals and instrumentals, which he mixed into one of the songs. (I am kicking myself that I didn't find time to record my own Webgrounds. Next time.)

And the best thing: it's free. That's right. Click on the picture below and you can download the 6-song EP _gratis_. If you like it, [head over to his site](http://www.andyosenga.com/2008/09/16/letters-to-the-editor-vol-ii/) and donate something to the cause.
