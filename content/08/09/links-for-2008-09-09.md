- [Wright on The New Creation](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BetweenTwoWorlds/~3/386873239/wright-on-new-creation.html)
    
    If this is the new creation that the Bible promises, you can understand why I don’t want just to “go to heaven when I die.” Who wants just heaven, when God promises heaven and earth?
    
    OK, I want to read this book.

- ['Now we have risen and we will destroy them all...'](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctliveblog/archives/2008/09/now_we_have_ris.html)
    
    Local Hindu fundamentalists are using extreme rhetoric about Dalit Christians, who are at the bottom of India's social hierarchy. On segment 2 of the broadcast, one of them says, "Now we have rise and we will destroy them all." The 'them' is us Christians.
    
    How will the global church respond?
