So, it was time for a little blog reorganization. I'd started chrishubbs.com about a year ago, with the intent of posting more regularly there on topics surrounding the church plant. Well, we're no longer at the church plant, so that doesn't really make sense. In addition, my old scheme of having a place where my various family members could blog never really came to fruition, because, well, I seem to be the only inveterate blogger of the bunch.

So, my conclusion: time to move things around. So, with the help of [my intrepid hosting provider](http://gfmorris.com), those of you visiting thehubbs.net/chris or rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy (yes, I know there is still at least one person with a bookmark to that original location... and I won't name names, but I'm married to her!), you will now be seamlessly routed to the new chrishubbs.com. All the same content, just a new location.

If you notice anything acting weird, let me know.
