...I need a new blog theme. One that's cleaner, less cluttered.

I really like the one that Geof is using over on [gfmorris.com](http://gfmorris.com), but of course now that he's using it I can't just go pick it up and use it, too.

Any suggestions? Guess I'll be looking around when I get some time.
