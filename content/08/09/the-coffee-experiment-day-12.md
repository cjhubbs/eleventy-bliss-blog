Wow, [it's been a week](/08/09/the-coffee-experiment-day-5/) since I've posted an update on The Coffee Experiment. I think it's really time to stop calling it an experiment, and just call it a new normal part of my everyday life. I've consistently been setting the timer to have the coffee brewed for me in the morning, and it's done a good job at keeping me going through the day. At the moment I'm still working through the bag of Starbucks dark roast that's been in the freezer. I imagine it'll take me another few weeks to get through it. After that, I'll head down to [Brewed Awakenings](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com) and decide what to try next.

Speaking of [Brewed Awakenings](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com), I hung out there for a while on Friday morning and tried a couple different drinks. First, Nate suggested a Don Correllejo, which is a double-shot espresso with Mexican chocolate added. Yummy. After that I had some of their daily light roast, which was also good, even drinking it black. I need a job where I can just spend mornings hanging out down at the coffeehouse. That would rock.

One funny thing I found out when visiting my folks this past weekend: it seems that my mother, a life-long coffee-disdainer, within a day or so of the start of my Coffee Experiment yet having not yet read about it on my blog, took up the coffee habit herself. Sounds like it's so far, so good for her as well. I think everybody in our family now drinks the stuff.

So, wow. I'm now a coffee drinker. I feel so grown up.
