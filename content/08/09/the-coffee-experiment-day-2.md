For 31 years I have professed to very much dislike coffee. If in need of caffeine to keep me going, I will resort to a diet pop of some sort, or, in extreme cases, Red Bull. However, my Diet Pepsi consumption levels have been high for the past month, and given the cost of Diet Pepsi and the knowledge that even diet pop has been shown to be not-so-good for you in studies, I figured it was time to give the coffee a shot. We've got a communal coffee pot here in the office where Folgers is brewed for donations.

Yesterday was day one. I took my coffee black and it was not too bad. The caffeine did its job just fine, and I didn't find myself craving the Diet Pepsi for the buzz... only for the sweetness. I had brought a Diet Pepsi along and went ahead and drank it for lunch.

Today is day two. I started the morning with two cups of coffee, this time using some non-dairy creamer, which I found helped things out quite a bit. And today I haven't craved Diet Pepsi at all. Coffee also seems to fill me up less than the pop did; it feels more like I've just drank lots of water.

Anyway, I don't know that I'd consider myself a total convert yet, but two days in I'm appreciating the concept of drinking coffee. Next stop: brewing it for myself at home in the mornings. I'll wait a bit for that one and see if the habit takes.
