I'm not sure whether to call this Day 4 or Day 6 of The Coffee Experiment. Do I count the weekend where I didn't drink coffee? I guess I'll be conservative and call this Day 4.

The office coffee, to this point, has been palatable. While being Folgers, which [Allie](http://lapointemusic.blogspot.com/) assured me Saturday night isn't really coffee, it has been drinkable with a bit of powdered creamer added for good measure. This morning, though, is a different story. This morning the coffee is bitter and nasty. Glad I got some sleep last night because I'm not gonna be getting any caffeine assistance this morning.

[Daniel noted](http://twitter.com/ddeboer/statuses/930319119) that for this reason he takes his own coffee to work. While at the grocery store yesterday I was contemplating picking up some coffee to brew at home, but thought I might wait a few more days to see how The Experiment pans out. After this morning, I'm thinking I might accelerate that purchase schedule a bit.
