After yesterday's run-in with completely nasty office coffee, I decided I would try brewing some better coffee up at home. While [Jason](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/09/22/the-coffee-experiment-day-4/#comments) and [Daniel](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/) both suggested a french press, I decided that I should first make sure this coffee thing is gonna stick before I make the investment. So I pulled our drop coffeemaker out of the basement (where it is stored awaiting visitors) and set it up to brew this morning.

We had coffee stored from the last time we've had visitors, too, which isn't terrifically fresh, but at least has been stored in the freezer. It's a Starbucks dark roast. I set it all up last night and set the timer for 0500 this morning, which is ten minutes before my alarm goes off. I was wondering if I'd smell the coffee all the way back in the bedroom. I didn't, though I think that is mostly because we have all the windows open and the ceiling fans on. I did, though, _hear_ the thing start brewing just before my alarm went off to officially wake me up.

I poured a cup, splashed in a little milk, sat down with my breakfast cereal and the newspaper. It was really pretty good. Once this bag of coffee is used up I might want to try something a little lighter, but still... not bad at all, and far better than yesterday's office fare.

I had been thinking that I had an insulated cup that I could take along to the office with me, but I guess we must've gotten rid of it some time ago. So, only one cup for me this morning. I'll find a mug today and be able to bring that second cup along to work tomorrow. I'm starting to think this experiment might just be a success.
