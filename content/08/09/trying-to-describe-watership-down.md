I finished reading Richard Adams' _[Watership Down](http://www.amazon.com/Watership-Down-Novel-Richard-Adams/dp/0743277708%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0743277708)_ last night and, when adding it to [my reading list](http://www.chrishubbs.com/books-i-read-in-2008/), found it rather difficult to describe. Figuring that few of you ever look at my reading list, (which is fine,) and knowing that my attempt amused me, I thought I'd post the description here, too.

> This is a hard novel to describe, not because it's nondescript, but because short descriptions would leave out so much. It's a story about rabbits. Let's try this on for size: if Tolkien were to have written a story the length of one of the LotR books, and set it in modern day, and narrowed the scope from "save the world" to "find a new place to live" and written it about rabbits instead of hobbits, you might get something like Watership Down. I enjoyed it.
