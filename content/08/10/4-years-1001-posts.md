Four years ago I started this thing called blogging, not, as they say, with a bang, but [with something more akin to a whimper](/04/10/this-is-my-first-post/). Since then the blog has relocated twice (from rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy to thehubbs.net/chris and finally to chrishubbs.com), undergone several theme makeovers, and has generally featured relatively mundane commentary on life, church, politics, and whatever else is on my mind.

Thanks to those of you who stick around to read my stuff, and thanks even more to those who interact in the comments. I wonder what this place will look like four years hence?
