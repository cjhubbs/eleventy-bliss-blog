So [yesterday afternoon I noted](/08/10/the-church-search-week-2/) that the next church on our short list for visiting during the Church Search was probably [Cedar Valley Bible Church](http://www.cedarvalley.org). I know a few folks there, including the couple that has brought Andrew Peterson and company to town twice for concerts. I've been to a wedding there, too, and my overall impression was that the church might be a little further over into the conservative homeschooling culture than I'd be comfortable with, but then, it might be OK.

The only other [note I'd made](/08/09/beginning-the-church-search/) about Cedar Valley thus far was when perusing their [Doctrinal Statement](http://cedarvalley.org/doctrinalstatement.shtml) online, it seemed to me that they had a far more detailed and lengthy statement on the End Times than do most doctrinal statements I've read. A very literal, pre-trib, dispensational sort of end times view. Still, as of yesterday, the church was still on my short list.

Then last night I cruised on over to the Cedar Valley website again to check out Sunday morning service times, and I noted this link on the sidebar: "[2008 Second Coming Conference](http://cedarvalley.org/secondcomingconference.shtml)". That's right, in November Cedar Valley Bible will be bringing in a special speaker from [Friends of Israel](http://www.foi.org/) to speak three times over two days. The topics:

- "Close to Construction" - Presentation on the movement in Israel to rebuild the Temple and how it could fit into Bible prophecy.
- "Pre-Tribulation Rapture" - A look at some different views of the rapture along with Biblical proof for the pre-tribulation position.
- "Signs of the Times" - Biblical evidence that we are now living in the end times.

And that's just about a deal-breaker for me. Let me explain a little bit why.

I grew up in what I'd consider a pretty standard set of evangelical churches. We attended a C&MA church for a while in Fremont, NE, then [a Bible church](http://www.gracebiblegranbury.com) in Granbury, TX. I got the basic dispensational teaching on the end times - basically, _Left Behind_ without all the dramatic stuff that made LaHaye and Jenkins best-sellers. Imminent rapture, followed by a 7-year tribulation, followed by Christ's return for 1000 years, followed by Satan being let loose again on the earth, followed by another clean-up and the ultimate destruction of the earth and creation of a new one, etc. Most of the time I was just confused by it. Maybe it was partly my practical engineering nature - we're not gonna know what's happening until it's done, right? So who really cares?

I stayed basically in that theological position until reading N. T. Wright's _Surprised by Hope_ a year ago. In _Surprised by Hope,_ Wright explains, among other things, the amillennial position on end times in a way that actually made sense to me. It turns out there is a whole 'nother way to interpret the passages in Peter, Thessalonians, and Revelation that I had never been introduced to. And that there were legitimate, reasonable Christians who believed it. Talk about an eye-opener. Since then I've read a couple of books by Kim Riddlebarger on amillennialism, which too have been helpful. At the moment I'd say I'm at the point of leaning toward an amillennial position, but feeling no need to be dogmatic about it. There are far more important things to get worked up about than the end times.

Which leads me to my end-times deal-breaker with Cedar Valley Bible. This (apparently second-annual) "Second Coming Conference" shows me that they're very interested in being dogmatic about a pre-trib dispensational end-times viewpoint. And while I'm OK with them believing that (heck, [Noelridge](http://www.noelridge.org), [Imago](http://www.imagochristicp.org), and [Stonebridge](http://www.stonebridgesite.com) all have the word "premillennial" in their doctrinal statements), I'm not really OK with a church being dogmatic about it. That just won't work for me.

Becky and I had a good talk about end-times stuff last night and why I feel this way about it. I don't know that we've decided anything yet, but I'm really leaning toward taking Cedar Valley off our list.
