Abraham Piper writes a blog I quite enjoy over at [Twenty-Two Words](http://twentytwowords.com). He seems like a guy that I would quite enjoy. We've actually developed an email correspondence of sorts over the past few weeks. It has gone something like this:

**Abraham**: Your comment on my blog got flagged as spam. Sorry, I don't know why. I approved it for you.

**Me**: Thanks! I enjoy your blog.

**Abraham**: Your comment on my blog got flagged as spam again. Sorry, I don't know why. I approved it for you.

**Me**: Thanks! Keep up the blogging!

**Abraham**: Your comment on my blog got flagged as spam again. Sorry, I don't know why this keeps happening. I approved it for you.

**Me**: Why does wordpress.com hate me? Anyway, thanks! I'll keep commenting!

I'm sensing a theme here.

Abraham: maybe sometime we can exchange emails on a different topic. Until then, please keep blogging, and thanks in advance for resurrecting my comments.
