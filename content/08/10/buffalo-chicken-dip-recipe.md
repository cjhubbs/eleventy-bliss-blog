[Lydia](http://lrpresley.wordpress.com) asked for it, so here it is...

**Ingredients**

- 2 (10 ounce) cans chunk chicken, drained - I prefer to boil a couple of chicken breasts and shred those in place of the canned chicken
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup Ranch dressing
- 3/4 cup pepper sauce, such as Franks® Red Hot®
- 1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

**Instructions** Heat chicken and hot sauce in a skillet over medium heat, until heated through. Stir in cream cheese and ranch dressing. Cook, stirring until well blended and warm.

Mix in half of the shredded cheese, and transfer the mixture to a slow cooker. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top, cover, and cook on Low setting until hot and bubbly. Serve with celery sticks and crackers or tortilla chips or, my favorite: Fritos Scoops.
