During an online conversation with [Lydia](http://lrpresley.wordpress.com) this morning I was chiding for her unfamiliarity with Gilbert & Sullivan's "Three Little Maids from School Are We". Just to get everyone on the same page, here it is:

But then I got to thinking about _my_ familiarity with Gilbert & Sullivan, which leads me to an embarrassing admission: most of my familiarity with the music of Gilbert & Sullivan comes from two sources: the movie _[Chariots of Fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/)_, and the ["Cape Feare" episode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Feare) of _The Simpsons_.

In _Chariots of Fire_, as I recall, one of the main characters is interested in an actress who is playing one of the three little maids in _The Mikado_. There's also a scene when the olympic team is traveling on the ship and they're singing Gilbert & Sullivan songs around the piano. (The scene always sticks in my mind because the audio is just off - the piano chord sounds a split-second before the actor's hand hits the keys.)

In _The Simpsons_, the villain Sideshow Bob tracks down the Simpson family (who were living on a houseboat in a witness relocation program), ties up the parents, and is just about to kill Bart. Bart stalls Sideshow Bob by challenging him to sing the entire score of _The Pirates of Penzance H.M.S. Pinafore (thanks for the correction, Jamie!)_. Bob can't resist the challenge and so sings and sings and sings while the boat floats down the river, into town, and to the authorities.

I really should take some time to become more familiar with these guys.

_\[Edit: I found a good version of the Simpsons' scene.\]_
