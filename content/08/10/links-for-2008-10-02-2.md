- [This moment in conservative intellectual history - Crunchy Con](http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2008/10/this-moment-in-conservative-in.html) - "...the reason \[Palin\] has sounded so godawful in some of these interviews is because she did a godawful job in those interviews. And until shown otherwise, it is fair to surmise that she did a godawful job because she doesn't know what she is talking about. And THAT should worry all of us, even as we heartily wish for this woman of high character and principle to rise to the challenge." - tags: [SarahPalin](http://delicious.com/hubbsc/SarahPalin) [politics](http://delicious.com/hubbsc/politics) [Election2008](http://delicious.com/hubbsc/Election2008)
