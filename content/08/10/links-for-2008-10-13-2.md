- [The Culture Chart - Rands In Repose](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/10/12/the_culture_chart.html)
    
    The people who are responsible for defining the culture are not deliberately doing so. They do not wake up in the morning and decide, "Today is the day I will steer the culture of the company to value quality design".
    
    They just do it. The individuals who have the biggest impact on the culture and company aren't doing it for any other reason than they believe it is right thing to do, and if you want to grow in this particular company it's a good idea to at least know who they are and where they sit. You need to pay attention to this core group of engineers because as they do, so will the company.
