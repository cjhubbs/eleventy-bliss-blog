    Dishonest character attacks would presumably be doubly ineffective, but I'll concede personal attacks sometimes prove to be a winning tactic. I'd nevertheless argue for a focus on issues, for if it can be shown that the approach I advocate and the approach I deplore are both viable political strategies, surely the former approach is preferable. After all, politics should be a means to the end of effectively governing the country and bringing about its improvement, or at least preventing its degradation.

    In the end the Palin candidacy is a symptom and expression of a new vulgarization in American politics. It's no good, not for conservatism and not for the country. And yes, it is a mark against John McCain, against his judgment and idealism.
    
    I gather this week from conservative publications that those whose thoughts lead them to criticism in this area are to be shunned, and accused of the lowest motives. In one now-famous case, Christopher Buckley was shooed from the great magazine his father invented. In all this, the conservative intelligentsia are doing what they have done for five years. They bitterly attacked those who came to stand against the Bush administration. This was destructive. If they had stood for conservative principle and the full expression of views, instead of attempting to silence those who opposed mere party, their movement, and the party, would be in a better, and healthier, position.
