    "Conservatism is not an ideology. It's a disposition. And sometimes it takes what Oakeshott called "trimming" to keep the ship afloat. Moderation matters.

    "\[Obama\] had some discretion as president \[of the Harvard Law Review\] to exercise an element of choice for certain of the positions on the masthead; it wasn't wide discretion, but he had some. And I think a lot of the minority editors on the Review expected him to use that discretion to the maximum extent possible to empower them.

    "The bigger the defeat, if it happens, the more distilled will be the remnant. And the more extreme the policies. And so the cycle continues until denial breaks down. It took the Tories a decade. And they're still not back in power in Britain."
    
    Andrew Sullivan gets it right, methinks.
