Thoughts from multiple discussions over the last week:

Most of the time, when people come to tell you that they're frustrated or upset with you (be it your spouse, a friend, a church member, etc), what they're looking for first of all isn't a solution to the problem; what they first want is to be heard. Down deep they know that you love them and want the best for them, but if you go immediately into problem-solving mode without having first stopped to really listen, instead of helping the situation you end up reinforcing their unhappiness.

It's hard to just keep your mouth closed, listen, and not immediately be defensive, but quiet listening and acceptance (not necessarily accepting the fault, but accepting that the hurts are real) will accomplish much.

I still have plenty to learn in this regard.
