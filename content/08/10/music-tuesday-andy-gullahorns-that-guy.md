[Andy Gullahorn](http://www.andygullahorn.com) is a guy that will sneak right past you without you noticing, if you let him. A supremely-talented songwriter and guitarist, Andy has perfected the songwriting technique I'll call the "Gullahorn Gut Punch", GGP for short. His song tells a story, gets you all involved, and then at the last moment sucker-punches you with a conclusion or moral to the story that you were not expecting... and that takes your breath away. I first experienced the GGP when I first heard Andy as he sang "Holy Flakes" during a concert back in 2005. But Andy takes it to a whole 'nother level in the song I want to share with you today.

The song is called "That Guy", and is on Andy's latest album, called _Reinventing the Wheel_. It starts out this way:

> He scoped out the market All the women and kids With so many distractions Nobody noticed him Nobody noticed him He had a jacket a size too big A skullcap on his head And a couple of homemade bombs He duct taped them to his chest He taped them to his chest

You're already into the story, right? What's gonna happen? The first time I heard this in concert the audience was breathlessly on the edge of their seats. For real.

> God loves that guy God loves that guy

Now _there's_ the Gullahorn Gut Punch. Whammo. All those horrible things you were thinking about this terrorist are suddenly reproved as Andy reminds us that yes, God loves that guy. Ouch. Then comes verse two and the bridge:

> He followed his heart To a co-worker’s bed He could have salvaged his marriage with kids But he chose to leave instead He chose to leave He thought it was love But it was just a mirage So he sits in his idling car Parked in a closed garage Inside a closed garage
> 
> God loves that guy God loves that guy
> 
> Me on the other hand I can write somebody off Like the last check for a student loan I can love when it’s convenient But it’s not always convenient It’s not always the easy road I want to look past the outside to the well-meaning heart To the good they forgot that they had Teach me to love, teach me to love Teach me to love like that

OK, if the song ended right here it'd already be an awesome song. But Andy takes it up another notch here with a sort of reverse-GGP.

> He messed up again Wanted to disappear But he can’t ‘cause he’s easy to find I see him in the mirror I see him in the mirror
> 
> God loves that guy God loves that guy

And here's the beauty of the song. For two verses we've been remonstrating ourselves about our lack of love for others, feeling down on ourselves. And then in this third verse, Andy sneaks up on us and gets us back, telling us to remember: God loves us, too. Wow.
