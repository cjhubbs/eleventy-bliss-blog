- Your house doesn't have to be amazingly clean to invite friends over.
- Even if it _was_ amazingly clean when the night starts, it won't be when it ends. Not with 4 kids playing for three hours.
- That's OK. You can always clean up again.
- Good food + good conversation = a great time.
- Hearing friends' back stories is fantastic.
- When your friends read your blog, you have to try to remember which stories you've already blogged and thus shouldn't re-tell.
- We should do this more often.
