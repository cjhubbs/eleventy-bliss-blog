A few weeks ago [I wrote about a bad experience](/08/09/why-i-dislike-salespeople-or-at-least-their-tactics/) we had with an in-home sales call from [Rainsoft of NE Iowa](http://www.rainsoftneiowa.com/). I wrote the rant, emailed it to every Rainsoft of NE Iowa email address I could find, and that was that. Both of the email addresses I found for Rainsoft of NE Iowa bounced, and Rainsoft corporate doesn't list an email address on their website, so I figured that was the end of it.

Then last week I got a phone call from Terry Bonik, who owns Rainsoft of NE IA. He had been notified of my blog post earlier that day, apparently by someone from Rainsoft corporate. In summary, he expressed these details:

- He apologized profusely for the bad experience.
- He told me that the saleswoman who visited our home has worked for him a long time and has never had another complaint like ours.
- He agreed that three hours was far too long a visit, that they typically are only an hour in length.
- He objected to my characterization of their giving us bottled water to taste but then not advising we buy the drinking water filtration unit as a "bait-and-switch". Usually, he said, people do buy the drinking water filter, and so that's a sample of what they would get. Our case just happens to be the exception, since we have pretty good water here in Hiawatha.
- He volunteered to send me a $100 Home Depot gift card in hopes that it would help remedy the situation.
- He asked if I would be willing to take my blog post down. I told him I'm not in the habit of taking down blog posts, but I would be willing to post an update on the situation. So here we are.

As I told Mr. Bonik on the phone, I rarely complain like this, and when I do, I even more rarely expect a response. I was quite pleased to get a response from him and was happy that he included some literature about the Rainsoft products. I don't know how soon we'll be in the market for a water treatment system, but I will add Rainsoft back to my list of firms to consider.

Now... I wonder if it'd be too forward to see if [Chris Hubbs Design](http://www.chrishubbsdesign.com) could be of any help for his web-hosting issues? :-)
