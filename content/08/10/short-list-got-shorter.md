Well, we talked about it some more last night and agreed that [Cedar Valley Bible Church](http://www.cedarvalley.org/) is off our short list for the reasons [I discussed earlier](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/10/20/an-end-times-deal-breaker/). So now we're back to looking at our short list, figuring out where to head next. Not sure if we'll visit [Stonebridge](http://www.stonebridgesite.com) one more week or skip down to the next church on the list.

More likely we'll sit down with the phonebook, newspaper, or some other reference list and work through the short list again to figure out what places we might have missed... then we'll go from there. Still praying for guidance on a daily basis.
