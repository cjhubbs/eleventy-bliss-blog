[![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/68/169968331_2335519a5a_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/wallyg/169968331/) It's October 1st, which, among other things, means it's time for the baseball playoffs. This has long been a favorite time of year for me. I love watching baseball, or if a TV isn't available, listening to it on the radio. And today we get a trifecta, with the meat game of the baseball sandwich being the Chicago Cubs starting a home series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

No sense in me adding to all the blather about the Cubs; just watching Sportscenter this morning they had features on "The Curse" (including the goat, the black cat, etc), the 100-year drought (there have been 4 states added to the USA since the Cubs last won the World Series!), etc, etc. As Lou Piniella said yesterday, the time for talk is done. Now it's time to play ball. I'm too biased to make any good predictions here, but, as I told Richard on the phone this morning, I'd love to see a Cubs/WhiteSox cross-town World Series... as long as the Cubs win it. :-)

Go Cubbies!
