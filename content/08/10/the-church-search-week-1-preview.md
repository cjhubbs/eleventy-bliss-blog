Well, tomorrow morning we officially begin our look for a new church here in the Cedar Rapids area. We're starting at a church called [Stonebridge](http://www.stonebridgesite.com/), a medium-sized Evangelical Free church on the southwest side of town. They're just on their second week in a new building, which actually didn't affect our decision to try them out... if anything we're tentative, figuring that it'll take them a few weeks in the new building to hit stride and get the kinks worked out.

I'm surprised by how nervous I am about visiting a new place tomorrow. I know, I'm an engineer, I don't do change well. We'll just pray that it goes well and that God gives us some clarity in the upcoming weeks and months as to where we should land.
