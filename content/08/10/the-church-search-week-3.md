After deciding early in the week that Cedar Valley Bible was off our short list, we spent a lot of time talking about where we might go next. We know the other place we definitely want to try out is [Maranatha Bible Church](http://www.maranathabible.org), so we tentatively decided last night that we'd head there this morning.

Then last night Laura decided she didn't want to sleep. From 3:00 until 5:00 she was awake in our room at least four times. Needless to say, Becky and I didn't get a lot of sleep. Finally Laura went to sleep and slept in until 8:00. As I write this at 9:15, Becky is still sleeping. Given that we'd need to leave the house in 30 minutes to get to Maranatha on time, I think we'll be cashing it in this morning and giving it another shot next week. Part of me feels guilty for not getting to church; the other part of me is happy that we have the freedom to just rest when we need to. God is good.
