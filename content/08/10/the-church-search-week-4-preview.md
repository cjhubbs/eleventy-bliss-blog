This week our plans have us heading to [Maranatha Bible Church](http://www.maranathabible.org). We know the Maranatha pastor and youth pastor and their families - good folks all around. From their website I see that Pastor Aaron is working through a series in Isaiah, which should be interesting. 10:15 AM on Sunday. Always tough to go someplace new, but a little easier when there's familiar faces.

Oh, the other place I'm familiar with Maranatha from: church softball. Guess there might be a few more familiar faces there than I was originally thinking.

As usual, I'll do some analysis/review on Sunday or Monday.
