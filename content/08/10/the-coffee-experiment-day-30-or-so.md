I have just about finished up the bag of Starbucks dark roast that we had here at home, what to get next? Well, I came home from work yesterday to find that my beautiful wife had picked up a pound of Columbian Orange Bourbon light roast from [Brewed Awakenings](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com), and a coffee grinder to go with it. What a great surprise!

So this morning, after one false start (didn't grind the beans finely enough the first time), I've got a pot of coffee that tastes awfully close to what I drink down at BA when I visit there. Very good stuff. At some point maybe I'll try out the french press and be a true coffee snob, but for now this stuff is working for me just fine.
