I am the oldest of five children. We span nearly ten and one-half years from oldest to youngest, four boys and then a rather special little sister. Today we reach something of a milestone: that youngest of the Hubbs children, our sister Rebecca, turns 21. To honor her on her birthday, I thought I'd pull out some photos. Unfortunately, I don't have any really OLD ones to post. :-(

(She's the one in the middle in this picture, with my wife Becky on the right and Aaron's fiancee Emily on the left.)

At Andrew's wedding this summer, with her oldest brother:

She's HOW old?

Happy birthday, sis! We love you lots!
