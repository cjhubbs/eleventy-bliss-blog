Lately I've had a quote from _Chuck_ (a rather fun TV show on NBC Mondays) set as my IM status message. (Oh, it's also at the top of my blog header.) In the show, Chuck complains that it'd never work to have a relationship with his hot love interest Sarah, because she's a CIA agent, and he says he'd try calling her, and she wouldn't be available because she'd be "off somewhere in Paraguay quelling revolution with a fork..." I loved it. What a great line.

So it's been my IM status for a week or so now. And every time Ryan starts a chat, he starts it out this way: "viva! viva! viva!". (The first time he followed up with "fork that!" :-) )

For Ryan, I have but three words, and I'll even make 'em Spanish: Â¡Si se puede!
