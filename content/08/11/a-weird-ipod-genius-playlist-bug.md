Discovered this one last night: when I tapped the Genius icon to create a Genius playlist out of the currently-playing song, the playlist it created began with a different version of that song. It was repeatable, happened twice.

In detail: I was playing "All the Way Home (live)" from Andrew Peterson's _Appendix M_ record. I hit the Genius button to create a playlist, and it generated one quite neatly. Unfortunately, rather than starting the playlist with "All the Way Home (live)" from _Appendix M_, it started the playlist with "All the Way Home" from AP's _Carried Along_.

Don't know quite what's going on here, but something ain't quite right with the Genius.
