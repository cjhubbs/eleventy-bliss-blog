![](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cover.jpg "The Faith of Barack Obama cover")I recently signed up for Thomas Nelson Publishers' Book Review Blogging program, and the first book I've chosen is _[The Faith of Barack Obama](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595552502?ie=UTF8&tag=scifirev-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1595552502)_ by Stephen Mansfield. I chose to review _The Faith of Barack Obama_ back before the election, but only now have been able to read and review the book. It's interesting how perspective changes now that Obama has won the presidential election.

I approached _The Faith of Barack Obama_ with a good bit of curiosity as to how the author would approach the subject. In the days leading up to the election we have been besieged with arguments over Obama's faith - is he really a Christian? Didn't he get raised as a Muslim? Isn't that pastor of his church in Chicago kinda weird? The temptation is for each author's perspective on Obama's political views to color their observations about Obama's faith. I was happy, then, (and feeling as if I was in quite unfamiliar territory!) to read _TFOBO_. Author Mansfield manages to draw a fair, compassionate picture of Obama's faith as Mr. Obama has himself expressed it in books and interviews. In the short (150-page) volume, Mansfield acknowledges seeming inconsistencies between Obama's faith claims and his political views - notably on the issue of abortion - but avoids drawing conclusions, leaving things for the reader to wrestle with in their own mind.

A chapter toward the end of the book seems out of place and suspiciously like filler material; that chapter examines other "faces of faith" in the political scene, giving thumbnail sketches of the faith of Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush, and John McCain. All told, though, _The Faith of Barack Obama_ is a fair journalistic look into the beliefs of our next president, and helpful reading.
