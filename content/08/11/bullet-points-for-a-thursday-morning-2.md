It's been a crazy week so I'm reduced to one of these play-by-play lists. Sorry.

- Note to self: eating at Texas Roadhouse only two hours before playing a rec league basketball game: not such a good idea.
- Looking forward to getting out of town this weekend.
- There is pretty much nothing cuter than a four-year-old excited about being invited to a friend's birthday party.
- Is Thanksgiving really only two weeks away? Where has the year gone?
- I'm getting a kick out of [Fake Geof Morris](http://twitter.com/fakegfmorris/) this morning.
- It's been far too long since I've listened to Mel Brooks' _The Producers_ soundtrack. Hilariously clever lyrics.
- I'm with [Kari](http://rmfo-blogs.com/karibeth/archives/2008/11/12/i-can-hear-you/) - it's too early for Christmas music.
