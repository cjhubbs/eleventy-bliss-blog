Good friends aren't afraid to say hard things.

Last night I had a friend tell me: "Hey, Chris, this church search blog thing is cool, but you need to get your butt in gear and actually get to church."

Now, he and I both understand that we've had good reasons for not getting to church the past two weeks, and his comment was somewhat in jest, but still, that's the kind of thing a reliable friend will tell you. I'm blessed to have a friend like that.
