When we were in Minneapolis last weekend I happened upon one of those dangerous places for me to go in: a pen shop.

Let me back up a bit. I have become quite a fan of fountain pens over the past couple of years. I've not bought any real expensive pens, but have managed to enjoy and then lose two separate [Lamy Safari Al-Stars](http://www.amazon.com/Lamy-Safari-Al-Star-Fountain-Pen/dp/B0009F1I84) the past two years - one fell out of my pocket on an airplane, the other dropped off my lanyard undetected last summer. I've been resisting the urge to buy another one... but that resistance proved futile on Friday. So, I came out of the store with this:

I've been using it this morning at work and I had forgotten just how much fun it is to write with a fountain pen.

Officially, Becky declared that this was my Christmas present from her, so I'll say this: thanks, Beck, for the present. It's fantastic. I love it. :-)
