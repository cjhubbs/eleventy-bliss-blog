It's my mother's birthday today, and out of respect for her (a respect that I wasn't prone to show in my younger years, but that's another story) I won't mention her age.

However, I will mention that she has accomplished much in her years, raising and schooling five children, serving and caring for friends and family, consistently modeling Christ-likeness to those around her, tireless for nearly 37 years as a wife and nearly 32 as a mother.

Today, this son rises to call her blessed.

Happy Birthday, Mom.
