On an internal discussion board at my workplace today, a co-worker (who is a Christian, though a bit of the far-right cynical type) posted this:

> Full up your gas tank today. And any other necessary purchases. Once the elections are over, anything that they've been holding off on can now be done. I expect that the repercussions of this economic meltdown have been held at bay and international moves that will make us unpopular have been tabled until after the election.

To which I have (and posted) this response:

I refuse to live in fear.

Political parties, bloggers, cynics, and conspiracy theorists of all stripes use fearmongering as a motivator to try to get us to do what they want. If you're on one side, it's fear of gays, liberals, taxes, big government, and athiests. If you're on the other side, it's fear of theocracy, invasion of personal privacy, neocons, and big oil.

No more.

A reminder from [Romans 13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2013;&version=47;): "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God."
