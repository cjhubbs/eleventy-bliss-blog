    "A gentleman in the back raised his hand and suggested that we stop thinking about online and offline as mutually exclusive terms. The reality, he suggested, is that there is little distinction between the two. The worlds are converging and life online and offline is becoming more synchronous and synonymous. Kids under 10 years old will never understand the difference between having friends (or contacts) online and having them offline. Just like they'll lack understanding for what it means to do their banking offline or listening to music on CDs."
    
    Bingo.

- [My wife made me canvas for Obama; here's what I learned | csmonitor.com](http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1103/p09s02-coop.html)
    
    "I learned in just those three hours that this election is not about what we think of as the "big things."
    
    It's not about taxes. I'm pretty sure mine are going to go up no matter who is elected.
    
    It's not about foreign policy. I think we'll figure out a way to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan no matter which party controls the White House, mostly because the people who live there don't want us there anymore.
    
    I don't see either of the candidates as having all the answers.
    
    I've learned that this election is about the heart of America. It's about the young people who are losing hope and the old people who have been forgotten. It's about those who have worked all their lives and never fully realized the promise of America, but see that promise for their grandchildren in Barack Obama. The poor see a chance, when they often have few. I saw hope in the eyes and faces in those doorways. "

    Flagged as spam, again. :-( Next time I'll try listing a different web address and see if that's what's setting it off.

    Ah, yes, Dr. Batts, and his predilection for having his classes sing "A Mighty Fortress" on Reformation Day.
