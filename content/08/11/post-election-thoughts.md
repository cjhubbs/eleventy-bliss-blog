So much has been said by so many this morning that I don't really have anything brilliant to add. Still, I'll consolidate a few thoughts here.

- The scene at Grant Park in Chicago last night was amazing. Just amazing.
- It's good to have an election decided decisively. No nightmare like the month of November 2000 this time.
- To those of you who supported Obama: his presidency won't be as awesome as most of you think.
- To those of you who opposed Obama: his presidency won't be as terrible as most of you think.
- As Christians, it is our responsibility to pray for, respect, honor, and obey our leaders.
- We owe it to President-elect Obama to put aside our cynicism for a while, to assume the best instead of the worst.
- The kingdom we wait expectantly for is not an earthly kingdom.
