We had plans to go to church on Sunday. And the best of intentions. But even though we were all up quite early thanks to the time change, the cold and cough situation at our house made it seem prudent to stay home. As much as we'd like to attend, everyone would probably appreciate not being infected by Addison's runny nose and my cough.

Next week, Lord willing.
