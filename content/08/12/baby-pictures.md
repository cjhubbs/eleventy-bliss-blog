Well, these are over a month old now, but better late than never. Let me just say the things that they can do with 4-d ultrasound now are crazy cool.

Before anyone asks, we don't intend to find out the gender of the child beforehand, and even if we'd wanted to know, the kid wasn't being cooperative on this particular day.

Due date is the last week of March or so. :-)
