Nothing like a holiday and a week off work to slow down the blog posting.

We started our Christmas celebration on Christmas Eve, attending the service at Stonebridge. While it was a bit longer service than I expected, it was quite good, and the girls managed to sit through it (a whole hour!) without making too much ruckus. Then we made a quick trip down to the Fedex office to pick up the new laptop that had made it as far as the distribution office but not actually delivered.

Christmas morning we opened presents. Highlights for the girls: Addie got a little tent and sleeping bag; Laura got a scooter and a "spotting scope". (It looks like a pirate spyglass to me, but Diego calls his a "spotting scope" and that's all that matters to Laura. :-)) The girls also ended up with a multitude of puzzles and DVDs. I got some good stuff, too: some gift cards to my favorite local fast-food places (guilt-free eat outs!), a new fountain pen (OK, I've had it for a few weeks, but it's a Christmas present none the less), and a couple of CDs. I got Becky a new jewelry box and a Baby Blues book; she appears to be enjoying both of them.

On Wednesday we're headed up to Wisconsin to see my family; Andrew and Heather are in from Washington; Ryan is in from the _other_ Washington (DC), and Aaron and Emily are getting married on Saturday! Exciting times for the Hubbs family. Then next week "real life" starts again and I have to go back to work. I _am_ thankful, though, for this Christmas break. A week and a half off of work is such a lovely thing this time of year. Happy New Year to you all!
