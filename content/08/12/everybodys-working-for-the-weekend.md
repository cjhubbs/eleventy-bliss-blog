Yes, we have a weekend coming up. Unfortunately, we'll be heading into the weekend with a house full of sickies - Becky, both girls, and I are all fighting colds, coughs, and sore throats. Ick. So, here's my list of guesses of things we'll do this weekend.

- We'll want to sleep in tomorrow morning, but won't really get to, since the girls pretty much are up at 7:00 regardless of what day it is.
- We'll rent another DVD or two from the store and catch up on a bit of our movie watching. Maybe Wall-E or Hancock.
- We'll hit CiCi's for cheap-o pizza.
- We won't get to church, given that we're all feeling icky.
- We'll visit the library sometime... probably Saturday.
- We'll watch some college football... most definitely the Florida/Alabama game.
- I won't post anything more interesting than this to the blog.

There's my profound list for Friday. I'll check back in on Monday to see what kind of score I get.
