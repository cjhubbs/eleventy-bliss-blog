Our little Addison (age two and a half) caught a low-grade stomach bug earlier this week. She wasn't notably ill or uncomfortable, just sleeping more than usual and not wanting to eat much of anything. That it was, in fact, a stomach bug became clear on Wednesday morning when she threw up. Still, she was running around like normal, and talked more and faster than an overcaffeinated chipmunk for the first ten minutes after I got home from work.

Later on Wednesday, with church activities canceled due to other folks being sick, we decided to go drive through Culver's and bring some burgers home. (Oh, and some cheese curds... yum yum.) Addie wanted to eat, so we went ahead and gave her a quarter of a cheeseburger and a few fries. And I tell you: that girl went to town.

She ate the first few fries in no time flat. She asked for more. What the heck, we said. If she's hungry and wants to eat, she can have all the fries she wants. So she ate a couple more fries, then started in on the burger. She had eaten probably half the burger, and had the rest of it half-chewed when I saw her make a gagging face. I warned Becky and she grabbed Addie's plate (by now empty except for a few fries) and up came the burger. After a couple more heaves she was done, and her determination was remarkable. Without even sparing a second, two words came out of her mouth.

"More ketchup."

See, it didn't matter that she'd just thrown up her entire dinner back on to her plate. What mattered was that there were three unscathed french fries left on that plate, and there wasn't enough ketchup left for those fries. That, my friends, is focus.

While she didn't get the rest of those fries, she did start managing to keep food down Wednesday night, and by Thursday afternoon she was eating another cheeseburger, and more french fries, and feeling fine.

\[Disclaimer so I don't feel like a bad parent: yes, we regularly feed our kids stuff healthier than cheeseburgers. The end.\]
