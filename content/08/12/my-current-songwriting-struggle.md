Songwriting, you ask? Yeah, if [you missed it](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/12/10/a-fun-evening-a-late-night-and-musical-kinship/), I was invited to attend the Iowa Songwriter's Guild meeting last month and they planted the bug again. So I've been keeping the songwriting idea in mind, looking for and writing down ideas, phrases, and so on. I have at least one idea that I really like as a concept; now I have to find a way to put actual words to it.

![songwriting](http://www.chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/songwriting.jpg "songwriting")As a worship leader and accompanist for many years, one of my greatest gifts has been that I have an immense capacity for remembering music and lyrics and then playing them back. I could sit down with nothing more than a list of song titles and play and sing you songs for hours and hours. That skill, though, seems to become a curse when it comes to songwriting. Because I have trained my brain for so many years to remember and replay other people's melodies and lyrics, now when I try to create my own phrase, I write down two words and it makes some other song lyric pop into my head. Play a couple of chords and it pops a song into my head. And once it's in my head, it's hard to banish.

I'm going to keep at it, though, and hope to attend January's Guild meeting with at least _something_ to show for my efforts. I may not ever turn out a great song, but it's at least worth the effort to try.
