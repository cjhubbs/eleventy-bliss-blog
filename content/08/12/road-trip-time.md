Tomorrow morning I will get in the car and, rather than heading to work, I will embark on one of my signature crazy-man concert road trips. Previous editions of the road trips have taken me to Chicago and Nashville... this time I'm heading west, to Omaha. The goal this time: the kickoff concert of the 2008 _Behold the Lamb of God_ Christmas tour, featuring [Andrew Peterson](http://www.andrew-peterson.com) and friends.

My current plans are to leave Cedar Rapids first thing in the morning, meet Curt McLey for lunch in Elkhorn (suburban Omaha) around 11:30, and then head over to the church where the concert will take place. It will be good to catch up a bit with the gang of musicians who make up this tour - [Andy Osenga](http://www.andyosenga.com), [Andy Gullahorn](http://www.andygullahorn.com), [Jill Phillips](http://www.jillphillips.com), [Ben Shive](http://www.benshive.com)... talented songwriters and musicians, all... and when you put them all on the same stage... amazing things happen. The concert is at 7 pm and then it's just 4 short hours on I-80 back home. Good times.

If you haven't heard _Behold the Lamb_ before, you should go buy yourself a copy from the [Rabbit Room store](http://store.rabbitroom.com). Best Christmas album I own, hands down. I'll be bleary-eyed and saddle sore come Wednesday morning, but it will definitely have been worth it. Hopefully I'll have some good pictures to post when I get back. Only 18 more hours to wait...
