When Andy Osenga's _The Morning_ came out two and a half years ago (to [much](/06/04/andrew-osenga-the-morning/) [fanfare](/06/05/sweet-musicy-goodness/) on this blog) I would not have predicted that _[New Beginning](http://andrewosenga.net/song-vault/new-beginning/)_ would become the signature track off the record. _Early In The Morning_ would've been my bet, with then either _[House of Mirrors](http://andrewosenga.net/song-vault/house-of-mirrors/)_ or _[Marilyn](http://andrewosenga.net/song-vault/marilyn/)_ next on my list.

Thirty months later, though, _New Beginning_ has become the most durable track, evidenced by, if nothing else, the fact that Andy is performing it [almost](http://www.andyosenga.com/2008/12/07/late-nighter/) [every](http://www.andyosenga.com/2008/12/04/sadies-birthday/) [night](http://www.andyosenga.com/2008/12/03/starting-the-tour/) this year on the Behold the Lamb Christmas tour.

The bridge of the song still gets me every time:

> I can feel a prayer rising And I don’t even know the words Still the groaning is the postage And it will not be returned Though we’re living in this rubble Of our reckless plans and games We are reaching for the promise That we will not stay the same...

Thanks, Andy, for a great song.
