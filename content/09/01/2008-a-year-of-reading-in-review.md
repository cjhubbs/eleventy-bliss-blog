This the only year-end post I'll write; just a summary of [my book reading list from 2008](http://www.chrishubbs.com/books-i-read-in-2008/).

Some quick details:

**Total Books Read:** 78. This is down a bit from 86 last year.

**Fiction:** 57\. **Non-fiction:** 21.

That ratio is still weighted a little heavily toward fiction, I think, but when I know how shallow and quick some of those novels were and how long and think some of the non-fiction was... well, it evens out.

**Favorite novel of the year:** [_A Prisoner of Birth_](http://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Birth-Jeffrey-Archer/dp/0312379293%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0312379293) by Jeffery Archer. This was far and away the best, most enjoyable story I read all year. It's essentially a modern-day retelling of Alexandre Dumas' _The Count of Monte Cristo_. What sold me on it, though, was that there were characters you could really root for. Good guys that were really good. Honorable supporting characters who remained honorable. Such a good story. I should put it on reserve at the library again.

Runner up: [_The Time Traveler's Wife_](http://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Wife-Audrey-Niffenegger/dp/015602943X%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D015602943X) by Audrey Niffenegger.

**Favorite non-fiction of the year:** This is tough because non-fiction spans such a range of subjects. Some high points, though:

- [_James Van Allen: The First Eight Billion Miles_](http://www.amazon.com/James-Van-Allen-First-Billion/dp/0877459991%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0877459991) by Abigail Foerstner. A biography of the Iowan who played a huge role in space exploration.
- [_Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing_](http://www.amazon.com/Newjack-Guarding-Sing-Ted-Conover/dp/0375726624%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0375726624) by Ted Conover. An inside look at the correctional officers who run Sing Sing prison.
- _[A Case for Amillennialism](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCase-Amillennialism-Understanding-End-Times%2Fdp%2F080106435X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1215282338%26sr%3D8-1&tag=scifirev-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)_ by Kim Riddlebarger. Quite helpful.

**Worst book of the year:** [_How Would Jesus Vote?_](http://www.amazon.com/How-Would-Jesus-Vote-Perspective/dp/1400074061%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1400074061) by the late D. James Kennedy and Jerry Newcombe. I thought [my blog review](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/10/30/book-review-how-would-jesus-vote-by-d-james-kennedy/) of it was bad until I read [Ron's review](http://www.moreron.com/2008/10/31/book-review-how-would-jesus-vote/). He said, in short:

> The book is awful. Simply awful. I canâ€™t stress to you how amazingly awful this book is. Do not buy, read, or borrow this book. I will likely use my copy for kindling in the fireplace this winter.

I love Ron.

OK, that's enough book wrap-up for this year. I'm contemplating a change in format for book reviews next year, doing a full post on each book and cross-posting them to Amazon to build a little bit of reviewing credibility there. Dunno, it's just a thought. \[No, Geof, I'm not doing it entirely because you changed the format of GNM.\]

Next year's list will still exist in some format. First book on it will be an old one by Stephen Baxter. Almost finished it for 2008, but not quite.
