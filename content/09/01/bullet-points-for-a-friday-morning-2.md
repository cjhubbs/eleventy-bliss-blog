I've been neglecting this blog for the past few weeks, so it's time for an update of sorts. So... bullet points!

- We're in the home stretch of the pregnancy... just a little more than two months until baby #3 is scheduled to make his/her appearance. The girls have finally decided that they'd like a little brother - they want to have a prince to play with them when they're playing princesses.
- We've decided on sticking at Stonebridge for the forseeable future, and we're starting to plug in. First up: small groups. The group we're joining starts up next Monday night. It'll be good to just sit down and get to know some folks.
- In the vein of church stuff, I've contacted the music pastor at Stonebridge and arranged a time to get together and talk about how I might occasionally serve on the worship team. The key word here is _occasional_. I don't want to be in a position where I'm indispensable. I think it can be worked out.
- On the work front, the project I'd been working on for the past 18 months got shut down last week. All of us working it are getting transferred to new projects and new groups. I'm going to be joining a group that focuses on aircraft certification. It'll mean a lot less coding and a lot more documenting, but it'll be very good experience and learning for my DER ticket.
- It's still winter in Iowa, but it's been at least tolerable the past week. It got up above freezing yesterday, and we haven't had any significant snowfall this week. I can handle winter when it's like this.
- I'm really looking forward to a weekend with very little on the schedule. Nothing scheduled for Saturday, just church on Sunday. Time to crash.

Well, enough for now.
