Andy Osenga [nailed it on his blog today](http://www.andyosenga.com/2009/01/19/the-reason/) by answering the question "how do know when I'm ready to < insert thing here >?". In his particular case the question revolved around when to record a CD, but he applies the lesson to all of life, and he's right on. The money quote:

> So my answer to the question “how do I know I’m ready to make an album?” is probably the same as the answer to many other questions like it. Because you feel the need and it’s become possible for you. And because otherwise you won’t be ready yet, won’t be ready yet, won’t be ready yet and then one day it will be too late.

> It’s like getting married, having a kid, driving a car. You’re never ready. You just decide to do what you feel you need to do, from my perspective this is called “obedience”, and you do it as well as you can and you wait for something supernatural to bless it.
