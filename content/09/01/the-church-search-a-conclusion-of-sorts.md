After Nick chided me last night about my infrequent blogging, and after [Roger](http://www.qwertyuppy.com) [noted elsewhere](http://www.rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/2009/01/19/observations-on-worship-teams/comment-page-1/#comment-20983) that he'd never really heard any conclusions from our church search, it occurred to me that I'd never really written a concluding chapter to [that story](http://www.chrishubbs.com/tag/church-search/). Let me fix that now.

We knew when we made our list of churches to visit that it wouldn't be a long list. We started with three churches that were our primary focus, and after [ruling out one of them](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/10/20/an-end-times-deal-breaker/) midway through, it was really down to two: [Maranatha Bible](http://www.maranathabible.org) and [Stonebridge](http://www.insidestonebridge.com). We visited both of those churches multiple times, evaluating and praying that God would direct us. Looking for churches is frustrating from a time perspective, too - there are only so many church services per week that you can visit. Patience is required. Not easy.

In the end, while we liked both churches and could've probably been happy at either, we decided back in mid-November that we would give it a go at Stonebridge. There's a lot of good going on there, the teaching has been solid, there are lots of ministry opportunities. We've signed up to join a small group that will start meeting next week. I'm excited to get the chance to start to get to know some people and really feel like I'm a part of the place. We'll see how God continues to lead, but for now, we're happy to start calling Stonebridge home. Let's hope it's a while before we have to do the church search again.
