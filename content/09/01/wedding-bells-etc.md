I've taken plenty of pictures the past few days, but the dial-up internet connection here at the folks' house isn't up to uploading them, so they'll wait until we get home on Sunday. (To be quite fair, my folks aren't Luddites in the least when it comes to the internet; they simply live so far out that their only options are dial-up or ridiculously-expensive satellite. But I digress.)

It's such fun to have the whole family together again for a weekend - Andrew and Heather are in from Washington; Ryan is here from Chicago; we've come up from Iowa and the rest are, for the moment, locals of Richland Center, WI. I have a feeling these full-family gatherings will be fewer and farther between as the years go on, so we need to enjoy these when we have the chance.

New Years' Eve we celebrated Christmas as a family, exchanging gifts and eating rather too much. I was blessed with a case for my iPod and a copy of N. T. Wright's _The Resurrection of the Son of God_, a lengthy volume that will likely keep me busy for a long while this upcoming year. (Thanks, Ryan!) New Years' Day was rather uneventful; much decorating was done at the church, and it was concluded by my brother Aaron's bachelor party - a party much unlike what typically comes to mind when you say "bachelor party". Let's just say it was attended by nearly 20 men who carried Bibles and weren't afraid to use them. :-) It was a good, encouraging time, enjoyed by all.

Yesterday, though, the preparations continued in earnest for Aaron and Emily's wedding. Final decorations were hung; we walked through the rehearsal; finally, we ate a LOT of tasty catered Mexican food for the rehearsal dinner, and celebrated Aaron's birthday. Oh, and Rebecca made the cakes, and whipped up a LOT of frosting. (Pictures to follow.)

Now it's Saturday morning and we're praying that the freezing rain forecast for late this afternoon holds off for a few extra hours so everyone can make it to the wedding. The big event is at 4:30 this afternoon, with dinner and dancing to follow. Big congratulations go out to Aaron and Emily on this landmark day in their lives. Now if you'll excuse me... I think I have a shirt to go iron.
