[![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LI9GWOY9L._SL160_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Weapon-Novel-Dan-Lenson-Novels/dp/0312374933%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0312374933)Normally I'd write up a whole 250-word review for a book I finished, but _[The Weapon](http://www.amazon.com/Weapon-Novel-Dan-Lenson-Novels/dp/0312374933%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0312374933)_ by David Poyer just doesn't inspire that sort of review. I've enjoyed Poyer's other Dan Lenson novels but this one was really just okay. A middling, disjointed story at best. As big a fan as I was of Tom Clancy back in the 90's, I should be the last to criticize authors for hanging on and writing a long series around a single character, but Poyer appears to be the next in a long line of authors that have burned out their series that way (see also: Tom Clancy, Dale Brown).

So, yeah, I read it, and was mildly entertained... but only mildly. It's time for these authors to start writing some creative plots instead of just stringing us along for yet another novel featuring the same guy in similar situations. Bleh.
