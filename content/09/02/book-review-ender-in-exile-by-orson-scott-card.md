I've been a big fan of Orson Scott Card's _Ender_ series since I read it a few years ago. _[Ender's Game](http://www.amazon.com/Special-Anniversary-Exculsive-Author-Recordings/dp/B001R1FXA8%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001R1FXA8)_ is just brilliant storytelling, and _Speaker for the Dead_ is equally good, perhaps even better themes and story woven through it. So when I saw _[Ender In Exile](http://www.amazon.com/Ender-Exile-Orson-Scott-Card/dp/0765304961%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0765304961)_ on the library shelf, it was a no-brainer to pick it up.

[![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aDRfygLhL._SL160_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Ender-Exile-Orson-Scott-Card/dp/0765304961%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0765304961)_Ender In Exile_ is not a book you would want to pick up and read as a stand-alone story without having at least read _Ender's Game_ first. _EIE_ takes place somewhere in between two of the final chapters of _Ender's Game_, telling the story of the teenaged Ender Wiggin. Once he had defeated humanity's mortal enemies and then had his reputation dragged through the mud in court martial, he then travels off to become the governor of a colony on another planet. A good bit of the story is told in the form of emails exchanged between Ender, his parents, his siblings Valentine and Peter, and Ender's former military commander. Ender manipulates situations with seeming effortlessness, always nobly wanting the good and right thing.

_EIE_ will be interesting to you if you've read and enjoyed the other books in the _Ender_ series. If not, I'd probably stay away from it, and would recommend _Ender's Game_ instead as a good introduction to Card's work. I think it's time that OSC come up with a new story and series.
