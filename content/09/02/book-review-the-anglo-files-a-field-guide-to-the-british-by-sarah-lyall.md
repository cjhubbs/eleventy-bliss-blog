Every culture has its quirks, but to really notice them and appreciate them you need to be able to look from the perspective of an outsider. When you can then write about those quirks with wit, humor, and insight, then you're approaching what author Sarah Lyall has achieved with _[The Anglo Files](http://www.amazon.com/Anglo-Files-Field-Guide-British/dp/0393058468%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393058468)_. Lyall, a correspondent for the _New York Times_, was posted to Britain some ten years ago, married a Britisher, and now raises two children there in London whilst still writing for the _Times_.

She's not afraid to tell stories on herself, either. And those stories prove insightful; they're not the clueless-American-rube-bumbles-around-Europe stories, they're the urbane-American-married-to-a-Britisher-still-baffled-by-Europe stories, which are really more fun. I myself have never been to Britain, but have long been intrigued with our brethren across the pond, so I very much enjoyed Lyall's insights into them.

Oh, and did I mention the humor? I was good-naturedly amused throughout the book, but one line in particular had me laughing out loud: she describes an inferior washing machine as having a spin cycle that took so long it should've been called a Ring Cycle. That's worth at least a couple of chuckles, folks.

All in all, a fun book. Definitely worth the read.
