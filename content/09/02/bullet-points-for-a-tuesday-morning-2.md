Laziness, and no big topics to contemplate. Put those two together and you end up with my blog as of late. Sorry folks. So, a make-up post of sorts.

- Only four more weeks until the baby is due. I'm sure we don't really understand quite how life will change going from 2 to 3 kids, but we'll figure it out. Excitement is building among all the residents of our little home. (Well, maybe not among the cats.)
- We're now several weeks in to our first [Stonebridge](http://www.stonebridgesite.com) small group and we're really enjoying it. It's fun to make some new friends. I did get a few weird looks last night when I briefly touched on [the whole gay marriage thing](http://www.chrishubbs.com/2008/11/20/recognizing-the-civil-religious-disconnect-or-what-to-do-about-gay-marriage/), but my lament about Christians being known more for their support of [Prop 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_%282008%29) than for their love for their neighbor was well-received.
- I'm applying for a new position here at work - a fantastic opportunity. Not going to say too much about it here just now, but I have an interview tomorrow at 1 pm.
- Another thing that's sneaking up on us - Laura will turn 5 this summer, and so the school questions start coming up. We've pretty well decided to homeschool her for the time being, and communicated that intent to our local elementary school last month. Now I've gotta get the ins and outs of the homeschool support/oversight system understood in preparation for next fall. Oh, and sign up with HSLDA.
- When I have trouble coming up with something for the fifth bullet, you know that either things have been fairly uneventful or I'm just having a horrible time remembering anything. \*sigh\*
