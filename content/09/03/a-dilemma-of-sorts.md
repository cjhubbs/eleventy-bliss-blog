Last week I accepted a position in a new group here at work. It's a group I've worked _with_ for several years, and I knew I wanted to work _in_ that group if the opportunity arose. The opportunity _did_ arise, and I got the position. While the exact transfer date has yet to be settled upon (sometime today we'll get it figured out, I hope), it's just a matter of time.

Which leads me to this dilemma. I have two options for my new office. (I'm not quite senior enough to get my own full-sized office yet... one more engineering grade to go.)

**Choice 1:** share a two-person office with a co-worker, getting the end of the office near the door. One desk, one table, file drawer.

**Choice 2:** get my own little mini-office. Basically it's standard cubicle-based office furniture inside a room with a door. It's not very big, but it would be my first-ever "own office".

One thing that makes the choice easier: my new department will be moving to a different building within the next couple of months, so my choice really only impacts the near term. What think ye, friends and readers?
