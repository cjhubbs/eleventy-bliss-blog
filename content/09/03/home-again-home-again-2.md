As a friend noted the other day, it's a bit of a weird feeling to know that you're driving only two to the hospital, but when you come home there will be three. But it's a great feeling, too, to finally leave the hospital and bring folks home. Becky and Katie were discharged on Sunday morning and came home to two excited sisters and two grandparents.

Since she came home there has been a steady stream of visitors: my brother Aaron and his wife Emily came down on Sunday for a few hours, my parents came down to visit today for the day, and my sister Rebecca and her roommate came down this afternoon and will head back tomorrow. Such excitement for such a small person! :-)

Katie was awake and hungry a good bit of the night last night and has then managed to sleep a good bit of the day today. Hopefully we can get her schedule switched around this week so we can get some better sleep... or, I should say, so Becky can get some better sleep; I'm afraid I slept through most all of it last night.

Such a blessing to have a home with a beautiful wife and three beautiful little girls. God is good.
