So my buddy [Geof](http://gfmorris.com) [quoted from this song](http://twitter.com/gfmorris/statuses/1387800670) this morning and completely got the lyric stuck in my head. [Andy Osenga](http://www.andyosenga.com) captures some things just perfectly here.

> I caught myself Looking in the mirror Wishing I was someone else Cause I was born With a bleeding heart And veins of loneliness
> 
> And I know it, I've seen it, I've held it in my arms But love can't seem to break me down
> 
> And I've pleaded, I've begged And I've bloodied my eyes Just to feel it To believe it will stick around
> 
> Swing wide the glimmering gates
> 
> I told myself The habits and secrets Were just to get me through To get me through the nights But I got lost In a world of angles In a city of greys and lies
> 
> And I feel it, I taste it This longing to be free Oh, the joy of believing like a child
> 
> So you, you there listening Will you send up a prayer For me To help me find the light
> 
> Swing wide the glimmering gates Leave your pride and pain Swing wide the glimmering gates And be innocent again
> 
> One day I believe I will open up my eyes To see the good work that was begun And I'll be the only things I've ever wanted to be And I'll know that I belong
> 
> Swing wide the glimmering gates Leave your pride and pain Swing wide the glimmering gates And be innocent again
>
