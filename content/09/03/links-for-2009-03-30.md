    12 characteristics. Interesting.
    
- [Miracles, creation, worldviews - and the gospel](http://www.confessingevangelical.com/?p=2021)
    
    Equally, those on the pro-evolution or miracle-sceptic side of the debate need to ensure they are not making the gospel dependent on their position, whether on the level of their arguments themselves (such as when Ken Miller suggests that God’s nature obliged him to create using evolution) or the more general fear that creationism or enthusiasm about miracles brings Christianity into disrepute in the eyes of its “cultured despisers”.
    
    All these views are, in the end, expressions of particular worldviews. Worldviews come and go, and if we lash the gospel to the mast of one worldview, we risk seeing the gospel get taken down with the ship when it sinks. Arguably, the history of modern western thought is, at least in part, the history of what happened when the gospel was lashed to the mast of a medieval worldview that has now sunk without trace.
