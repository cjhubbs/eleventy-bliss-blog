Back in college, [Dr. Batts](http://www.letu.edu/opencms/opencms/_Academics/Arts-Science/english/faculty/batts.html) suggested a cheap date: a trip to Walmart. His rationale? First, go through the food side of the store and eat the free samples, then, go back to the electronics department and watch whatever movie is playing on the TVs.

Well, 10 years ago I guess they still did have food samples and movies on the TVs at Walmart; now the samples are gone and the TVs run perpetual advertising. But last night we still managed a pretty fantastic cheap date.

Dinner for two + dessert + tip at a nice Italian restaurant: $1 after gift card. Mario Kart on the Wii at Best Buy: free. Mocha and Decaf Sumatra at [Brewed Awakenings](http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com): free thanks to a credit on my account.

Three hours out with Becky on a beautiful March evening: priceless.

(Of course, a couple more experiences with Mario Kart on a Wii will pretty much convince me that we need to buy one... which has the potential make the total financial impact of the evening a little bit more expensive.)
