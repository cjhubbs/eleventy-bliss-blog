That's the way my friend Steve used to describe it, and this week has been one of those weeks. Half my calendar at work has been meetings; each meeting seems to generate more tasks for me; the remaining non-meeting time doesn't seem to be sufficient to complete the tasks at a rate that will bring me anywhere close to keeping up.

Help is on the way, though: a loaner laptop to help me get work done _during_ meetings, and a minion junior engineer who can be responsible for some of my lower-priority-yet-still-time-consuming tasks. Next week is still meeting-heavy, but I have hope that my group and I are making progress.

On the home front, we were able to keep Katie asleep long enough last night for Becky and I to blow off some steam on the new Wii. So far we've only got the Wii Sports and Wii Fit, so we played a bunch of head-to-head sports. She quickly proved she could beat me at tennis, baseball, and golf. It's some small comfort that I can still take her in bowling, though. One of these days I'm gonna pick up Mario Kart and _then_ we'll see who's boss.

Now we approach Easter weekend, and it's gonna be the most relaxed Easter weekend we've had since I don't know when. Saturday is the 8th (!) annual egg hunt out in Stone City at the Berberich's - will be so good to catch up with them. It's been far too long.

I've got a post on music floating around in my head that I'm gonna try to get written this weekend, but until then, dear readers, be patient and put up with my automated link posts. Go read the articles if you're bored - they've gotta be good before I'll link 'em. :-)
