It's been a frustrating couple of weeks, but this does make the day cheerier: I just firmed up plans to road trip to Nashville on April 27 (less than two weeks from now!) to meet up with some friends ([Geof Morris](http://www.gfmorris.com), Mike Terry among others) and see [Andy Osenga](http://www.andyosenga.com) [play a show](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2127580/) with full band at [12th and Porter](http://www.12thandporterlive.com).

Yeah, who care if it's a 10-hour drive each way. I can't wait.

\[Oh, and also: I completely have the best wife in the world. Thanks, Becky, for being supportive of this.\]
