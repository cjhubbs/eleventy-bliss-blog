Last Sunday we visited [Noelridge Park Church](http://www.noelridge.org) for the morning service so Laura could participate in the AWANA recognition Sunday. (She's been a regular there in Cubbies even though we've not been attending Noelridge for the past 18 months.) As we got ready to go Sunday morning, I noted to Becky that it was nearly ten years, to the day, since the first time we visited Noelridge, immediately after we moved to Iowa.

**That was then...** 

Ten years. Nearly a third of our lives to this point. In one sense I look back and say "wow, time flies"; but in another sense I look back and remember all that we have lived through in those ten years, and it does, indeed, seem like a long time.

- Ten years ago we had been married less than a year, two kids moving across the country to an unfamiliar city and state. Now we're both into our thirties, have three kids of our own, and Iowa feels a lot like home.
- In ten years we've been from an old rental farmhouse in the country that leaked heat like a sieve in the winter, to unintentionally renting a house in town from the most notorious landlord in Cedar Rapids, to owning our own place, to starting to wonder when/if we'll outgrow our own place and have to look for something else.
- In ten years we've gone from being young newcomers at a [church](http://www.noelridge.org) to being in and [out](/06/09/things-are-changing/) of leadership, to then [dreaming up and leading](/07/09/changes-in-the-works/) a [church plant](http://www.imagochristicp.org), and then finally [being led away from the church plant](http://www.chrishubbs.com/tag/church-search/) to participate in [a different church](http://www.stonebridgesite.com).
- In ten years we've gone from knowing no one here to having made a lot of friends. Then it's just sad to see them go. We were sad to see the Majerle's move to Minnesota five years ago, though we were glad we could buy their house. :-) This summer, particularly, feels like the end of an era, with the Garner's moving to Indiana and the Finley's moving to Texas. I guess now we have new places to visit on vacations.
- In ten years Becky's job description has changed from "CAD drafter at a stone quarry" to "wood shop worker" to "mom of one" to "[mom of two](/06/03/short-on-sleep-but-full-of-joy/)" to "[mom of three](/09/03/its-a-girl/)". I'm pretty sure she likes her current job description best.
- In ten years my job description has been more consistent, changing only from "software engineer" to "software team lead" to "software certification specialist". I'm hoping to make the certification thing a long-term gig. Hopefully this fall it'll all come together.
- In ten years I've gone from being a smooth-cheeked youngster with plastered-down hair to slightly-less-plastered-down hair to a beard and shaved head. I've had this look going for three years now, and think I'll be keeping it for a while. Sooner or later I won't have to shave the head as much.
- In ten years Becky is still the beautiful woman who took my arm and came to Iowa sight-unseen. She's still kicking butt on the softball field every summer, growing yummy stuff in the garden, keeping our household running smoothly, and making our home a place I always want to come home to, and never want to leave.

I can only imagine the changes I'll have to reflect on if I'm still writing on this blog or something like it ten years from now... teenaged kids, middle age... I can wait. But if the next ten years are as rich and full and wonderful as the past ten have been... I will (continue to) be a man most richly blessed.

**This is now...**
