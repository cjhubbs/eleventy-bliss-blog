- Monday road trip to Nashville was awesome. Saw some friends, made some new ones, saw a great concert. (Geof recorded it and you can [download MP3s](http://tinyurl.com/ao-20090427-mp3s).)
- Driving 1300 miles in two days will make you a little bit saddle sore.
- Work has been somewhere between ridiculously crazy and insanely crazy for the past couple of weeks. Looks like it'll stay that way until the middle of May.
- I'll be traveling to Toronto for work in a couple of weeks. Looking forward to finally meeting [Dan](http://www.rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/) and [Laura](http://butterflyjar.wordpress.com/) in person.
- Listened to about 15 hours of D. A. Carson sermons/lectures on my road trip. That guy is an amazing teacher.
- At the moment I'm listening to Manchester Orchestra (which isn't a symphony orchestra, Dad, it's a rock band) and they're pretty darn good.
- Guess it's time to get back to work.
