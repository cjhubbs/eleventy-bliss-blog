This week business took me on my second-ever cross-the-border trip, once again to Canada, though this time to a part of Canada (Toronto) that felt much less alien then last time (Montreal). Something about them still speaking English in Ontario makes it a little more comfortable.

Anyhow, there wasn't much time for sight-seeing as we sandwiched a day of customer meetings and round-trip travel into a 48-hour window, but I _did_ get the chance to finally meet, in person, some "weird internet friends": [Dan](http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel), [Laura](http://butterflyjar.wordpress.com/), and Wally. First, a little photographic evidence, then, the narrative.

It should come as no real surprise by now to anyone that reads this blog that I have a group of "weird internet friends". We've had some visit in our home, and met up with others in Minneapolis, Nashville, Lincoln, and Charlotte. Each time I've found them to be decent, enjoyable people, and we've had great times visiting. I had a little extra anticipation this time, though; Dan and I had hit it off so well online that I figured our in-person meeting would either be brilliant or amazingly awkward.

This meeting fell into the brilliant category. Without minimizing my enjoyment of Wally's company at all, I have to say that Dan and Laura felt less like new acquaintances and more like long-lost family. We had a fantastic time visiting, eating dinner, and drinking coffee far too late into the evening.

While it is a nearly 12-hour drive from Toronto to Cedar Rapids, I extended the invitation to Dan and Laura that I'd extend to any of my weird internet friends (and you know who you are) - any time you have a long weekend and want to come visit, we have a spare bedroom, an expandable dining room table, and all the excitement of Eastern Iowa for you to enjoy on your visit. Hope to see you soon.
