- [I was wrong about Sotomayor speech - Crunchy Con](http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2009/05/i-was-wrong-about-sotomayor-sp.html)
    
    Good admission and update from Rod Dreher. Turns out that the excerpt from Sotomayor that all the conservatives are going on and on about is much less problematic if you set it in the context of her full speech. Shame on them for the mischaracterization.
