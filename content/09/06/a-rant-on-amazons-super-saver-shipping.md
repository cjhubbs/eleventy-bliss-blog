Mostly to save my Tweeps from a half-dozen tweets venting my frustration.

I ordered a [HDHomeRun networked tuner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010Y414Q/) and a chunk of ethernet cable from Amazon on Friday morning, June 12. The tuner was ordered from Amazon proper; the cable from whichever of their providers had it the cheapest. I opted for Amazon's super-saver free shipping, both to save the $6 and because I didn't have enough $$$ on the gift card I was using to pay for shipping.

Additionally, I ordered a RAM upgrade for my Mac Mini from newegg.com on Tuesday evening, June 16. It came with free shipping.

Now, as to arrival times.

The network cable shipped the same day I ordered it, and arrived in the mail on the 16th. Snappy response, well done to the Amazon retailer.

The RAM shipped from Newegg on Wednesday June 17th, and arrived this morning via USPS. 5 days, including the weekend. Not bad.

Amazon finally got around to announcing that my tuner had shipped on the evening of Tuesday the 16th. So it took them three full business days to even get around to shipping it. And the USPS tracking number they gave me says that yes, they entered the tracking number into the system on the evening of the 16th. However, the arrival scan for the package doesn't show up until **the afternoon of June 19th**. So between the time they boxed it up and the time they actually got it to USPS was _another_ three business days.

Now they're telling me that the anticipated delivery date to my home in Iowa (from, per the tracking info, someplace in Kentucky) is not until Thursday, June 25th - a full two weeks after I ordered it, and **a full nine days after they told me it shipped**. I know the USPS isn't the fastest carrier, but hey, that's just awful.

I have had better shipping service from Amazon in the past - maybe this is just a fluke. Or maybe it's part of a strategy to dissuade customers from actually choosing their free shipping option. Either way, it's pretty awful.

End rant. Carry on.
