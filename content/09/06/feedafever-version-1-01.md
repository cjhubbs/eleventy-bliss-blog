This morning Shaun Inman pushed out (with [notice via Twitter](http://twitter.com/shauninman/statuses/2278304910)) version 1.01 of the [Fever° feed reader](http://feedafever.com). First of all, major kudos to Shaun for the auto-updater built in to Fever°. (Yes, I'll go ahead and conform to the official naming of this tool, adding the little degree symbol to the end.) Once Shaun pushes the update out, Fever° will auto-update within 24 hours. Or, you can do an instant update from the menu. Very cool, very very simple. (Here's the [changelog for V1.01](http://feedafever.com/todone.txt).)

I'm not sure exactly what all kicked loose, because it seemed like some feeds started working even before I pulled down the 1.01 update, but since updating Fever° is kicking butt. The scrolling issues I reported in V1.0 are all fixed, and the feeds appear to all be pulling in nicely. I'm gonna run it side-by-side with Google Reader for the day to make sure they seem like they're catching the same stuff, and if Fever° passes that test, I'll be saying adios to GR for the foreseeable future.

Now if I could just get him to set up some sort of referral bonuses...
