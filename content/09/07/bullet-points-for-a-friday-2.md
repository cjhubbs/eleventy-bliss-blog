- Slow-ish week turns into busy weekend. Lots of family in town, softball tournament, leading worship. Fun, but busy.
- Oh, the occasion for all the family visiting: Laura turns 5 on Monday. Hard to believe I've been a parent for five years now.
- No matter how cool the gong is on "The Great Gate of Kiev", the solo piano version of _Pictures at an Exhibition_ is far and away superior to the orchestrated version.
- Just when I think my homebrew DVR is all working and I'm ready to blog about it, something else isn't working quite right. I'll be installing the Windows 7 Release Candidate tonight.
- I've been flexing my web design muscles again a bit this week and it's kinda fun.
- I'm down 7 or so pounds in the #20lbchallenge this month. This weekend's meal plans will be a challenge to that accomplishment. (Two months to go!)
- Looks like I'll have a quick trip to Ottawa, Ontario for business in a few weeks. Wish it were Toronto instead so I could meet up with Dan & Laura.
- I haven't had the heart or inspiration to blog about politics lately.
- All the things that are on my mind re: God and church are things that need to be worked through first in our lives before they're worked out on this blog.
- I reactivated the IntenseDebate commenting plugin - they've improved it a lot since last time I tried it. Now with Facebook and Twitter authentication! Leave a comment below and let me know what you'd like to have me blog about.
