I met [Nick Flora](http://www.myspace.com/coinlaundryloser) a few years back when he came along to play guitars with [Andy Osenga](http://www.andyosenga.com) at a little show in Omaha. They played Andy's "When Will I Run" and every time Nick sang the line that Derek Webb sings on the CD, he held in front of his face a copy of a magazine that featured Derek on the cover. Cracked me up.

Anyhow, enjoyed meeting Nick that night, but didn't really get a chance to hear much of his music. Earlier this week, though, I was able to download Nick's latest, _Great Escape_, from [Noisetrade](http://www.noisetrade.com). What a fantastic record. Nick has a good acoustic rock sort of sound - there are times he reminds me of Dave Matthews, other times of a cranked up Bon Iver, but mostly he finds his own unique sound, and makes it highly enjoyable.

I don't know how long his record will be available on Noisetrade, but I highly recommend you go check it out. Click on the widget below and you can download the record by either paying what you want or recommending it to five friends. You won't be sorry.
