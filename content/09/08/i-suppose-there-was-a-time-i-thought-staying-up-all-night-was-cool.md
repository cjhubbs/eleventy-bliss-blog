...but right now isn't it. After getting, by Becky's measurement, 11 inches of rain in the past 48 hours, our basement once again began taking on water. Looks like I should've bumped that sump pump higher up the priority list. Once again I am thankful for neighbors on both sides who are willing to loan out their Shop Vacs. I am happy this year to have one shop vac that has a garden hose attachment so I don't have to carry it out to dump it.

It's currently 1:45 on Friday morning or so, and the Shop Vacs have been running continuously since around 4:20 Thursday afternoon. The water is slowing down some now, I'm only having to go down and do some sopping up of puddles about every thirty minutes. The rest of the time I can just sit here and listen to the shop vacs run. You are never so ready for silence as you are after listening to three shop vacs run continuously for nine hours. Except for maybe after ten or eleven hours. :-)

So far I've listened to a couple of podcasts, watched two episodes of Arrested Development on Hulu, started a book, and annoyed anyone who was on Twitter to listen to my posts. If the water gets down to where I only need to check on it every hour, I'm going to try to take some naps. Until then I guess I'll just hang out and drink another Diet Pepsi. I had already planned to take Friday off of work; I didn't plan to spend it this way, though. There'll be plenty of cleanup to do tomorrow.
