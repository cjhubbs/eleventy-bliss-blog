- [Peggy Noonan: Pull the Plug on ObamaCare - WSJ.com](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204884404574362971349563340.html)
    
    "Every big idea that works is marked by simplicity, by clarity.... The president's health-care plan is not clear, and I mean that not only in the sense of "he hasn't told us his plan." I mean it in terms of the voodoo phrases, this gobbledygook, this secret language of government that no one understandsâ€”"single payer," "public option," "insurance marketplace exchange." No one understands what this stuff means, nobody normal.
    
    And when normal people don't know what the words mean, they don't say to themselves, "I may not understand, but my trusty government surely does, and will treat me and mine with respect." They think, "I can't get what these people are talking about. They must be trying to get one past me. So I'll vote no.""
    
    Noonan is right. I supported Obama and support healthcare reform, including some sort of public coverage, but it has to be clearly stated and sold for me to support it.
