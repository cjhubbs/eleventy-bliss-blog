OK, so it's entirely possible that at the ripe age of 32 I've just become an old curmudgeon, but in the past few weeks I've had a couple of experiences at church that cause me to wonder just how seriously we take this thing we call Sunday morning worship.

Now, I'll put some caveats at the front. Yes, I'm going to be talking about Stonebridge. Yes, I expect that there are people from Stonebridge who will read this. Yes, I'm going to ask some questions that will sound critical. So up front let me say this isn't about any one person, or any one service, or any one topic, but rather it's about the things I've seen, and about the mindset I think it reveals.

Experience #1: two weeks ago we ended the service with a great sermon from James, and started it with a good set of worship songs that were full of the Gospel - solid stuff. But the worship team had barely time to get off the stage, and the music had barely faded, before we were treated to one of the church staff dressed up in a superhero costume - complete with mask and cape and theme music! - to give us an announcement about an upcoming event. Hope you didn't want time to reflect on what you'd just sung about. You weren't going to get it.

Experience #2: this morning at church was "Family Sunday", which means that there was no Sunday School for the kids - the whole family got to sit in church together. Then, after three worship songs, the children's pastor was tasked with giving the message. First came a pseudo-introduction with a scripted "interruption" to give an announcement about a women's event. Then came the actual sermon from James, and it felt more like a gimmick than a sermon. There was a very distracting, ever-louder ticking clock in the background (for effect!) and at the end of three short points, during what seemed like a conclusion, the ticking finally stopped, and the pastor cut off the sermon mid-sentence and walked off the stage. And just like that, we were done.

Now yes, I know this morning was an attempt to be dramatic and illustrate the sermon point. But I'm afraid that what people are left remembering this afternoon isn't the point from James 4, but rather the awkward way everyone sat and looked at each other as the pastor walked off, as my daughter asked "is church over?". She was confused, too. And yes, Laura, church was over. We ended up spending more time driving to and from church than we did actually in the service this morning.

I fear that experiences like these reveal that we don't value enough the experience of Sunday worship. Yes, we show value to the Gospel in the songs we sing - but we don't value them enough to give folks time to meditate on the great riches of God's grace after singing. Instead, we distract them with superheroes in tights. Yes, we value and encourage the Sunday morning gathering, but then we allow gimmickry to replace Gospel proclamation, and send people home early, wondering "what was that?".

I remarked to my wife on the way home that, on a spectrum with stodgy and boring but solid on one end, and flashy, cool, and vapid on the other, our current church home is one or two ticks further toward the flashy end than I'm quite comfortable with. Don't get me wrong - I have great respect for a lot of people there, and have regularly heard the Gospel from the pulpit. But times like these past few weeks leave me wondering if our lip service to the Gospel isn't quite being backed up with the sort of Sunday morning gravity that it deserves.
