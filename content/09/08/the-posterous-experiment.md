To freshen things up a little bit for me, I'm going to start playing around with a Posterous blog. If you haven't checked out Posterous, it's pretty slick, and pretty much the simplest way ever to start blogging - just blog by sending emails, it does the rest. It's integrated to handle images, videos, etc, and will post new content back out to Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc, too. My plan is to just dump the random daily stuff out to my Posterous blog, and leave this one for more traditional topics like you'd normally see here.
