- Blog posting has been a bit slow lately since I typically post during breaks at work and my blog has mysteriously become inaccessible from work.  IT was no help in fixing it.  I'm using Posterous as a sort of go-between - a solution that works but that I'm not fond of.
- Had a good, full weekend.   
- Marriage conference Friday night and Saturday morning at church.  Very good.
- Watched a fun Hawkeye game Saturday night.  They whooped Penn State good.  
- Played on the worship team Sunday morning, lots of fun.
- Finally got the fascia and soffet on the garage painted.  That's been on my to-do list since last fall.  It looks a lot better.
- Found out Friday afternoon that the job transfer I've been trying to get for the past 6 months will be approved.  Will post something more officially on it once I go through all the official steps.
- The upcoming two weeks before the transfer will happen have the potential to drag a good bit.
- I have two book reviews that I need to get posted here before the publishers demand their books back.  Problem is, I've only gotten one of them read so far.  Posting one would be a start, I guess.
