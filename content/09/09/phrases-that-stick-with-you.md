Most of what I remember from Rocky & Bullwinkle is cheesy puns (which are AWESOME, by the way), but there is one phrase that has stuck in my vocabulary: "antihistamine money".  An example of usage:

"Wow, $100?  That's antihistamine money."

"Antihistamine money?"

"Not to be sneezed at."

I remain easily amused.
