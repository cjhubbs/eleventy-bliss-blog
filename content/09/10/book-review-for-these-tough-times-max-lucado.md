When you're hungry, sometimes you want something fancy, exotic, or robust.  Other times, though, you're just ready for comfort food.  Simple, nourishing, and refreshing to the soul as well as the body.   If we take that metaphor over to the world of books, at times you need a thick theology book or an explanation of some new philosophy, but at other times you need a book like Max Lucado's [_For These Tough Times_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0849901707?ie=UTF8&tag=scifirev-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0849901707).  In Lucado's short volume, he doesn't bring anything really deep or new, but brings rather a comforting message to those going through, well, hard times.  
_Tough Times_ is a small, short book - easily readable inside of an hour, but full of good reminders to the heavy heart - that God loves us, that He is in control, that we can rest in Him, that justice will, in the end, win out, and that we can be quiet and pray and look to God in our troubles.  I'd recommend it to read, keep on your shelf, and then pass along to a friend when the opportunity arises.  These are reminders that we can all use from time to time.
