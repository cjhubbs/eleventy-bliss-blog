    "...Hence I prefer the second way of expressing the position. I believe in Jesus, and therefore I believe the Bible – not because I always understand it or am in agreement with every “traditional” interpretation of it (see: literal six-day creationism), but because Jesus affirmed the Old Testament and commissioned the New Testament. This view frees us to suspend judgment on the meaning of “difficult” passages, to question received interpretations, without this unsettling our faith: because our faith rests on Jesus, not on our ability to understand every word of the Bible."
    
    Amen.
