Way I planned to spend Friday evening: reading a book and watching TV.

Way I actually spent Friday evening: feverish trip to Home Depot (20 minutes before close!) to rent the 100' sewer snake.

But it's not yet 10 pm, and the sewer is once again running freely, and at half the cost of calling a professional.

Still doing the post-mortem on the remains, but my first guess is that a small stuffed toy got sent to its' watery grave by a resident toddler.
