There is a more substantive post or two in here, I promise. But for now - bullet points.

- Sewer pipe was replaced, all the pipes are now flowing smoothly. Thankful for drains that drain and that it all got done before the snow started.
- We got our Christmas tree yesterday and amazingly enough Katie hasn't tried to pull it down yet.
- In the "for the first time in over eight months" file: all three girls slept through the night last night. AWESOME.
- I was invited to fill the pulpit at our old church plant for the Sunday after Christmas. (The new pastor will be on vacation.) I'm honored to be asked. Text will be 1 Peter 1.
- Oh yeah, did I say snow? We got just a bit overnight, but the forecasters are calling for the SNOWPOCALYPSE on Tuesday night and Wednesday - or at least 6 - 12 inches of the white stuff, along with 40 - 50 mph winds.
- Matt Chandler is the real deal. Continuing to pray for his recovery from brain surgery. This [pre-surgery video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VC5wP2gDrY) is awesome.
- Every time I think I've gotten to some conclusion on whether we're at the church we should be at long-term, something else comes up that pushes me back the other way. Kinda feels like we're still in a holding pattern. Still praying.
- And to finish with the truly trivial, we watched Nebraska do again on Saturday night what they seem to do best - snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. Nobody deserved to win that Nebraska-Texas game. Texas came away the winner anyway. \*sigh\*
