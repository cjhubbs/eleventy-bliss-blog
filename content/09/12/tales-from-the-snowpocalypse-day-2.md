Morning timeline:

- 0530: alarm goes off
- 0532: check of the cancellations page via my iPod touch shows work status as "2 hour delay"
- 0615: grudgingly head out to snowblow the driveway
- 0725: make it back in from clearing the driveway
- 0730: cancellations page says "snow policy in effect" (i.e. you don't have to come in, but you can) Conflicted as to whether or not I should try to go in.
- 0750: finished with a shower, decided not to go in.
- 0800: work officially closes, sends people home
- 0830: second pot of coffee on, Christmas music playing. AWESOME.

At least I didn't try to go in. First time work has sent people home for snow in the 10 years I've been there.

I think we've gotten about 8 inches here so far, heavier and wetter than I had anticipated. Now it's time for the temps to drop and the wind to start blowing really hard. Guess I've gotta hand it to meteorologist Joe Winters, he was right this time. I feel like I should seek him out and do my meekest ["I'm sorry, Dick Butkus"](http://mediacenter.fedex.designcdt.com/node/271) impression.

Happy snow day, everybody!
