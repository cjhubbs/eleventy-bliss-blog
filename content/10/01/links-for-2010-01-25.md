- [Storied Theology » Authenticity Part 3b: Forgiveness and Anger](http://www.jrdkirk.com/?p=95)
    
    "First, did you notice that our worship of God is given back-seat to our relationships with God’s children? Against our individualistic tendencies that see worship as a matter between me and God, or my heart alone before God, this passage says no, the quality of your community as a place that is living into the reconciled relationships that God himself establishes with us is our first priority."
    
    Good good stuff from Dr. Kirk.
