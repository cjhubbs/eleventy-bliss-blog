- [Storied Theology » Authenticity Part 3c: Sexuality](http://www.jrdkirk.com/?p=99)
    
    "As I indicated in the first post in this series, I think authenticity is important, even indispensable in Christian communities. But it is not a sufficient rule of practice to tell us either how to act (because we’re being authentic) or how we shouldn’t (because doing a particular action wouldn’t be authentic).
    
    Our rule of life is not who we are, but who we are being made to be in Christ, and the road he has led us on by which to get there: the way of the cross, which is the way of death, which is the formative narrative that determines what our life in community looks like."
    
    I promise I won't start linking every post, but this series from Dr. J. R. Daniel Kirk is really good stuff. Quickly becoming a favorite blog of mine.

    Geof is upfront, as ever, about his struggles with mental illness. A good brother who needs our prayers.
