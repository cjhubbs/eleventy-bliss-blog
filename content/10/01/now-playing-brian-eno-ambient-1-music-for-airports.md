Time to start something new around here - from time to time I'll highlight a record that I've been playing. I'll start with a rather obscure one this afternoon: Brian Eno's [_Ambient 1: Music for Airports_](http://www.amazon.com/Ambient-Music-Airports-Brian-Eno/dp/B0002PZVH0%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0002PZVH0).

[Brian Eno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_eno) is pretty much the king of ambient music, and Ambient 1 is one of his earlier works, dating back to 1978. This isn't something that you're going to want to sit down and just focus on for the entire 45 minute playtime, but it makes a beautiful backdrop to an hour, almost fading out here and there but never quite leaving the edges of your consciousness. Even if you're not typically a listener of ambient music, it's worth a try.

No promises about the video content on this one, but the music is worth a listen.
