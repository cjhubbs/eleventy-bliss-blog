In 2010 I'm undertaking the [Bible reading plan](http://journeyon.net/engage/scripture/reading) put out by [The Journey](http://journeyon.net), and this morning's reading hit an interesting combination of passages - Genesis 4, Psalm 4, and Matthew 4. The theme that links them all: offering right sacrifices to God.

Genesis 4 gives us the familiar story of Cain and Abel. Abel gives the right sort of sacrifice. Cain doesn't. Jealousy and murder ensues. Such a tragic story.

Psalm 4:4 - 8 follows up that sobering story with these verses:

> 4 In your anger do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent.
> 
> 5 Offer right sacrifices and trust in the LORD.
> 
> 6 Many are asking, "Who can show us any good?" Let the light of your face shine upon us, O LORD.
> 
> 7 You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound.
> 
> 8 I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.

David gets in several zingers here that speak directly to me in my daily situation:

- If you're angry with what you see happening, don't sin, but rather shut your mouth and search your heart.
- Offer right sacrifices and trust the Lord.
- The light of God's face on us will bring joy greater than any material possession.
- I can sleep in peace knowing that God alone is my security.

So what are these "right sacrifices" that God wants from me? A couple of texts quickly come to mind:

1 Samuel 15 - King Saul attempts half-hearted, doing-what-seems-right sacrifices, and is corrected by Samuel: God desires obedience rather than those sacrifices.

Romans 12 - reaffirms the command in 1 Samuel by telling us that we should present our bodies as living sacrifices.

So there it is, loud and clear: the right sacrifice that God desires is our _obedience_. If I'm wearing myself out doing lots of 'good things' thinking that God will be happy with me, while at the same time I'm ignoring areas in my life where I'm choosing to not be obedient to God, I'm doing it wrong. God has already justified me apart from any right living on my part. My obedience to him is an offering to show my love to Him for what He has already done. And, as the Psalmist says, I will find greater joy and peace in that life of obedience than in any striving for material things.

The final passage in today's reading (Matthew 4) fits in nicely with this lesson as well. Jesus goes to the desert and is tempted by Satan with some 'good' things. Jesus, though, sets the example for us by choosing obedience. I would do well to follow.
