Recommending blogs to follow is a risky proposition. The fact that I enjoy reading these blogs enough to recommend them undoubtedly says more about me than it does about the blogs themselves. Nevertheless, two blogs have emerged recently that I have found quite enjoyable and worth my time; depending on your interests, you might find them worthwhile as well.

[![Storied Theology](http://chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/jrdkirk-150x150.png "Storied Theology")](http://chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/jrdkirk.png)**First up is [Storied Theology](http://www.jrdkirk.com/), written by J. R. Daniel Kirk.** Dr. Kirk is an assistant professor of New Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary. I first got pointed to him by online friend [Mark Traphagen](http://foolishsage.com/), and I owe Mark a beer or two for that recommendation alone. I've linked him here a few times already, including [his thoughts on mixed martial arts](http://www.jrdkirk.com/?p=145) and a couple times on his series on [authenticity](http://www.jrdkirk.com/?p=72).

Reading a blog like Dr. Kirk's (can I call you Daniel?) reminds me why I at times think it'd be fun to attend seminary at some point; the level of discussion is stretching but not incomprehensible to this layman. Fortunately blogs like Dr. Kirk's provide a window into that world and an opportunity for discussion even for this engineer in Iowa. Worth reading.

[![downhill_both_ways](http://chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/downhill_both_ways-150x150.png "downhill_both_ways")](http://chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/downhill_both_ways.png)My other recommendation for today is something completely different: **Abraham Piper's new blog [Downhill Both Ways](http://downhillbothways.com/).** Presented as "Views and vignettes from South Minneapolis", Piper observes, thinks, and reports on his urban neighborhood, all the while proving that he is as adept in writing long-form as he is in short form.

I first encountered Abraham's writing on his short-form blog, [Twenty-Two Words](http://twentytwowords.com/), where he pithily comments on the world in posts of exactly, well, twenty-two words in length. When he noted [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/abrahampiper) that he was starting a new blog, I wasn't sure what to expect... but I've been quite taken with it. There's something strangely appealing about late-night walks through a big city, and Abraham's superb writing captures it beautifully. For starters, read his ["Why I Now Buy Cigarettes"](http://downhillbothways.com/2010/02/08/why-i-now-buy-cigarettes/) and ["Jumping Trains"](http://downhillbothways.com/2010/02/09/jumping-trains/).

Check these guys out and let me know what you think. Any new blogs you're reading and would like to share?
