- [The End of Intelligent Design? | First Things](http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2010/02/the-end-of-intelligent-design)
    
    "It is time to take stock: What has the intelligent design movement achieved? As science, nothing. The goal of science is to increase our understanding of the natural world, and there is not a single phenomenon that we understand better today or are likely to understand better in the future through the efforts of ID theorists. If we are to look for ID achievements, then, it must be in the realm of natural theology. And there, I think, the movement must be judged not only a failure, but a debacle."
    
    I'm not ready to take sides in this debate, but this is a very thoughtful piece, worth reading.
