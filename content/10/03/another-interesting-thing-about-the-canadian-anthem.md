A follow-on to [yesterday's post](http://chrishubbs.com/2010/03/01/on-the-superiority-of-the-canadian-national-anthem/) about the superiority of 'O Canada':

I was not surprised to read that there are [official lyrics in both English and French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Canada) for the anthem. I was surprised a bit, though, at the stark difference in the message of the two versions.

First, the familiar English version:

> O Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all thy sons command. With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free! From far and wide, O Canada, We stand on guard for thee. God keep our land glorious and free! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

But compare that with this English translation of the French lyrics:

> O Canada! Land of our ancestors, Thy brow is wreathed with a glorious garland of flowers. As is thy arm ready to wield the sword, So also is it ready to carry the cross. Thy history is an epic Of the most brilliant exploits. Thy valour steeped in faith Will protect our homes and our rights Will protect our homes and our rights.

A very different flavor to those, eh? An "arm ready to wield the sword", but also "ready to carry the cross". And rather than the English version standing on guard for the country, the French version stands in protection of "our homes and our rights".

Fascinating how they've chosen to keep the tune and meter the same between both versions, and accepted the inevitable difference in lyrical content.
