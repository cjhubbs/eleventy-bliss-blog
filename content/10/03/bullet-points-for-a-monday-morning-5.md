- We have high temperatures in the 50's forecast for this week. Incredibly thankful for spring to be making an appearance.
- Stayed up too late watching the Oscars last night. Have watched only two of the films nominated across all categories: _District 9_ and _Star Trek_. One of these days I'll catch up on some of the others. Very little time for watching movies these days.
- _Star Trek_ is the last movie I've watched in a theater. Before that I think it was _The Dark Knight_ the year before. At least that gives us lots of choices to watch on DVD.
- Three day work week for me this week. Then on Thursday we road trip to Indiana. Becky and the girls will drop me off in Indianapolis where I'll hang out/ride along with [Andy Osenga](http://www.ilikeandy.com) for a couple days while he plays some house shows.
- Becky and the girls will head up an hour north of Indy to visit some friends who moved there from CR last year. Everyone is pretty darn excited about it.
- Have the details lined up for Andy O to play a "house show" at [Brewed Awakenings](http://www.brewedcr.com) in CR on Monday, April 19th. Hope to get the "official" confirmation from Andy this week so I can start publicity in earnest.
