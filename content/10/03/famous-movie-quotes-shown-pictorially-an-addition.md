[Kottke linked](http://kottke.org/10/03/famous-movie-quotes-graphed) earlier this afternoon to [a nifty site](http://flowingdata.com/2010/03/08/data-underload-12-famous-movie-quotes/) where they've taken some famous movie quotes and represented them pictorially.

Very cool, but the quote that immediately sprang to my mind wasn't among them, so I decided to get in on the fun and create it here.
