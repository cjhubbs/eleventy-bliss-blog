Things I've linked recently:

- [Theology & Fear](http://www.jrdkirk.com/?p=415)
    
    "Theology finds its power to silence scripture (and people) from this claim to its standing as objective truth. But while objective truth exists, we can always only at best approximate it. The challenge for theology is not only to confess this in word but to live like it in deed: to treat itself as provisional, always subject to change and development and correction."
    
    Good summary from Dr. Kirk.
