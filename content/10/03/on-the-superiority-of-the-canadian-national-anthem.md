Watching the winter Olympics over the past two weeks, I caught at least a few of the medal ceremonies, including at least a couple (including the one after the amazing hockey game yesterday) where the Canadian anthem was played. Each time I was struck with the same thought, which I finally [voiced on Twitter](http://twitter.com/cjhubbs/status/9797731040) yesterday: that the Canadian national anthem is highly superior to ours. One friend [expressed the same thought](http://twitter.com/masterkari/status/9805397238), but another [quickly disagreed](http://twitter.com/birdit/status/9797965642). So, let me offer a few thoughts in defense of my assertion.

**Reasons that '[O Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Canada)' is superior to '[The Star-Spangled Banner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Spangled_Banner)'**

- **Singability.** The purpose of a national anthem is to be _sung_, right? 'O Canada' has a nice, singable melody, and a total range of just one octave, suitable to most voices. 'The Star-Spangled Banner', on the other hand, has a range of an octave and a fifth, which is a range typically only well-handled by professional singers. Live performances should be opportunities for national pride, however, when the US anthem is involved, they are more often adventures in vocal torture.
- **Inspiring Language.** 'The True North strong and free.' What a marvelous turn of phrase. And who can fail to be moved when singing "God keep our land glorious and free"? The Star Spangled Banner is just about a flag, with the bit about the country being sort of tacked on at the end.
- **Using words that people actually are familiar with.** With exception, perhaps, of the old English "thy" and "thee", "O Canada" is composed entirely of words that one might use in everyday writing or conversation. "The Star Spangled Banner", by comparison? _Spangled. Perilous. Ramparts. Gallantly._ Ugh.
- **Actually mentioning the name of the country**. "O Canada": 4 mentions, not counting the title. "The Star Spangled Banner": 0.
- **Not beginning and ending with a question**. Questions typically belong in plaintive, whiny songs, not broad anthems. Starting off "O say can you see?" and ending with "O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave?", while presumably intended as rhetorical flourishes, doesn't impart the same sort of solidarity as "O Canada, we stand on guard for Thee".

Sadly, any attempt to change the US anthem at this point would only result in choosing something worse. "God Bless America" is too overtly theistic to get official sanction; "America the Beautiful" has many of the same issues as the current anthem (hard to sing, odd words). There are occasional odd choices proposed, too, similarly troublesome. For instance, Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land": written by a communist sympathizer. And who wants to hear a folksy protest song played at the beginning of every sporting event and solemn political occasion?

Being a loyal American I will continue to honor my country by standing when the national anthem is played. But I will at the same time regret that our inferior anthem ensures that we will never have a scene like the one that played out in the Canadian hockey arena yesterday, with 18,000 victorious fans singing the anthem at the top of their lungs.
