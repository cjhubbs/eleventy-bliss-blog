Just found a link to a great thought that [Jared Wilson posted back in January](http://gospeldrivenchurch.blogspot.com/2010/01/gospel-frees-you-from-tyranny-of-hyper.html). Given that it's only a paragraph, and it's a good one, I'll quote it in its entirety.

> Yes, people watch too much TV and play too many video games and spend too much time on the Internet and what-have-you. But the proper response to our media over-saturation is not a rigorous attention to the explicitly "spiritual" in every margin of life. Be a Christian, not an ascetic. Don't be lazy, but realize that Jesus Christ did not die and rise for you so that you would stress out about whether you're being spiritual enough. So take a nap. Watch some television. The gospel frees you to chill the heck out.
