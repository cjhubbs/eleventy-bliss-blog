CNN.com has a blog post today exploring "[How Church Shopping is Polarizing the Country](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/24/how-church-shopping-is-polarizing-the-country/)". Written by law professors Naomi Cahn (George Washington University) and June Carbone (University of Missouri Kansas City) who have recently co-authored a book on cultural polarization, the particular focus on church shopping intrigued me. Heck, I was church shopping not all that long ago. I'm helping cause cultural polarization? I must know more.

Fascinating (and saddening) are their definitions of the two polarized camps: **traditionalists**, who "...believe in an eternal and transcendent authority that tells us what is good, what is true, how we should live, and who we are", and **modernists**, who "...would redefine historic faiths according to the prevailing assumptions of contemporary life". Modernists, they note, "...have become less likely to attend church at all."

In previous generations, they say, both modernists and traditionalists tended to attend the same churches, typically right in their community. Today, though, the ability to church-shop has the traditionalists seeking out churches that affirm their "personal values", and has modernists staying home.

The authors lament the decline of the mainline Protestant denominations that in previous generations housed both camps, and complain that today's evangelical churches (full of like-minded traditionalists) are self-reinforcing in belief, and that evangelicalism's close ties to the Republican Party serve to marginalize those who might be in agreement politically but not religiously (or _vice versa_). In the end, they say, traditionalists group together and talk only to themselves, and modernists leave church altogether, resulting in an increasingly polarized society.

There are certainly places where I disagree with the authors' views on the topic. I think that Protestants seeking churches where their beliefs are shared and reinforced is a **good** thing. And drawing rosy pictures of a post-WWII generation where everyone attended the same community church _regardless_ of what they believed only serves to hide the fact that those weak, any-belief-is-OK churches in large part _helped cause_ the modernist/traditionalist divide we see today, by valuing the form-over-substance mindset that was eventually cynically discarded by Generation X.

However, within the microcosm that is the evangelical church, there are good lessons to be learned here. We need to be vigilant to ensure that we limit our "distinctives" to the fundamental Gospel truths. As soon as our teaching, or even our church culture, becomes, even by way of unspoken assumptions, 'the gospel plus conservative politics' or 'the gospel plus homeschooling' or 'the gospel plus pre-millennial dispensationalism', etc., we will alienate those who either desperately need to hear the Gospel or who could be vibrant, participating members of our local body.

The good news that Jesus Christ is Lord of all is polarizing. We should not be surprised when law professors find it so. But there is still a lesson for us here: let the Gospel be polarizing, not the cultural things we are so apt to add on to it.
