Things I've linked recently:

- [kinnon.tv: Diss-Missional Discipline or Missional Discipleship](http://www.kinnon.tv/2010/05/diss-missional-discipline-or-missional-discipleship.html)
    
    Kinnon, in a review of a Kevin DeYoung piece, provides some excellent stuff, including this conclusion:
    
    "I am convinced that the healthy church going forward will be a church that disciples. Not discipleship in a classroom setting, but discipleship that see us living out our lives in deep relationship with others. As we are discipled and disciple, we will naturally and infectiously teach others to disciple. And I need to stress that that discipleship will need to include effective catechesis as we finally recognize how the present church is functionally illiterate when it comes to church history and a basic understanding of scripture. Discipleship will also include those "baptized" and those with no understanding of their need of baptism, yet."
