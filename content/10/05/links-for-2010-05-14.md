Things I've linked recently:

- [A Full Tank of Gas and Lots of Wyoming Ahead](http://dougwils.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7641:a-full-tank-of-gas-and-lots-of-wyoming-ahead&catid=136:dualism-is-bad-juju)
    
    Really good stuff from Douglas Wilson. An excerpt:
    
    "Picture a particularly "pious" little child who was impossible to give gifts to, because he would always unwrap it, abandon it immediately, and run up to his parent and say, "But what really counts is my relationship with you!" A selfish child playing with a toy ungratefully is forgetting the giver. This pious form of selfishness is refusing to let the giver even be a giver.
    
    We should not assume that in the resurrection, when we have finally learned how to look along that beam, in pure worship, that our bodies will then be superfluous. God will not have given us eternal and everlasting bodies because we finally got to such a point of spiritual maturity that we are able to ignore them. In the resurrection, we will have learned something we currently struggle with, which is how to live integrated lives. If God is the one in whom we live and move and have our being, it should not be necessary, in order to glorify God, to drop everything. We shouldn't have to keep these things in separate compartments."
