Things I've linked recently:

- [Evolution and Faith: Communicating Compatibility in Christian Higher Education, Part 4 | The BioLogos Forum](http://biologos.org/blog/evolution-and-faith-4/)
    
    A well-written response (by a college freshman!) responding to Ken Ham on the topic of evolution. The student gets to what, I'm increasingly led to believe, is the heart of the evolution/creation battle: the evangelical culture war.
    
    The student's initial article and Mr. Ham's response are linked near the top of this article. An interesting read.
