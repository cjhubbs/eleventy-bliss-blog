**Fidgetoid**, _n. an object with which one fidgets_.

A Google search reveals no substantive results, so I'm gonna call this a new one.

It came up after this Tweet from [Geof](http://www.gfmorris.com):

> I'm a fidgeter at a desk. I fidget. My current object of fidgeting is a UAH Hockey puck that Coach Cole gave me. Indestructible.

My reply:

> @[gfmorris](http://twitter.com/gfmorris) A hockey puck is a good fidgetoid. Can cause some damage if you get mad and throw it, though. :-)

There you have it: language evolution in progress. I can only hope that my language hero, the late [William Safire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire), would be proud.
