After taking quite a bit of time to make our [decision](http://chrishubbs.com/2009/10/21/joining-up-or-not/), Becky and I yesterday became members of [Stonebridge Church (EFCA)](http://www.stonebridgesite.com). For a while we were wondering if enough members would show up to form a quorum so we (and 14 others) could be voted into membership, but eventually enough trickled in to make it official.

It feels good to have made the decision and committed to a body of believers. We are very thankful that God has led us to this fine group of folks as we continue through life's journey.
