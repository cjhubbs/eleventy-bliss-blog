Things I've linked recently:

- [Maybe You Deserve to be Persecuted! | 9Marks](http://www.9marks.org/blog/maybe-you-deserve-be-persecuted)
    
    So I sometimes talk to my church about the "ministry of being normal". As believers, we are necessarily going to have a lot of distance between us and those who don't follow Christ. We live differently, love differently, hope differently. We're citizens of a different country.
    
    But it might be helpful if we limit the distance between us and the world in a lot of other ways. We don't have to flaunt our lack of a TV and be weird and preachy about grinding your own grain. That only serves to put unnecessary distance between us and the people we're trying to reach. Instead, we should try to engage the world around us, know what our neighbors care about, and try to inhabit the same universe they do.
    
    If they are going to persecute us, let us at least be for things that really have something to do with being a Christian.
