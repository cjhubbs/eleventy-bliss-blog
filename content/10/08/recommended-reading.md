I've occasionally passed along links here without much commentary. However, my reading pattern has changed a bit, thanks primarily to [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com) and my iPad. All my long-form reading now happens on the iPad, and it's been a great way to store, read, and archive articles when I don't have time to sit and focus reading in my feed reader.

So, here are my first set of recommended articles. The topics vary, but each has given me some interesting reading over the past few weeks.

**[Ten of the Greatest Maps that Changed the World](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1272921/Ten-greatest-maps-changed-world.html) - The Daily Mail**

A fascinating look at 10 maps from history that had significant cultural impact.

**[A Review of Ken Ham's "The Six Days of Creation"](http://www.fccplace.com/a-review-of-ken-hamms-the-six-days-of-creation/) - Daniel Jepsen, Franklin Community Church**

I grew up with Ken Ham's position on creation being the default "correct" position. I remember watching his videos in Sunday School when I was in high school. One of the things I've been wrestling with now is how to best understand Genesis 1 - 3 in context, within its genre, and how to make sense of the apparently ancient universe we see around us. (This challenge has only been heightened now that I have a six-year-old who is fascinated with dinosaurs.)

This particular review is a fair (though brutal) assessment of one of Ken Ham's videos. Worth a read.

**[What Social Science Does -- and Doesn't -- Know](http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_3_social-science.html) - Jim Manzi, City Journal**

A fascinating read on how difficult it is to get any useful results from social science studies. (Primary reason: so many influences, so hard to isolate to a single one for a study.)

**[Simply Lewis](http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=20-02-028-f) - N. T. Wright in Touchstone Magazine.**

N. T. Wright's thoughts on C. S. Lewis and _Mere Christianity_. A humble and yet not deferential critique of Lewis's classic work. The gracious concluding paragraph:

> And, as another imperfect apologist, I salute a great master, and can only hope that in sixty yearsâ€™ time children yet unborn will say of me that, despite all my obvious and embarrassing failings, I too was used, in however small a way, to bring people under the influence and power, and to the love and kingdom, of the same Jesus Christ.

More links later. Have fun reading!
