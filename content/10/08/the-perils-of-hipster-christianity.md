[Brett McCracken's column](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111704575355311122648100.html) that appeared on the Wall Street Journal website yesterday really hit home for me. [McCracken](http://stillsearching.wordpress.com), 27, outlines the increasing efforts that the evangelical church has made to try to attract and keep 20-somethings. Whether it's the obsession with being culturally savvy, or with being technologically cutting-edge, or with using shock tactics ('you've never heard your pastor talk about \*this\* before'), McCracken argues that they are simply gimmicks that may bring people in the door; "But", he asks "what sort of Christianity are they being converted to?"

Quoting David Wells, he further adds:

> And the further irony is that the younger generations who are less impressed by whiz-bang technology, who often see through what is slick and glitzy, and who have been on the receiving end of enough marketing to nauseate them, are as likely to walk away from these oh-so-relevant churches as to walk into them.

McCracken concludes that "cool Christianity" is not a "sustainable path forward", and that, "when it comes to church, \[twentysomethings\] don't want cool as much as we want real".

It's worth reading the whole post. I, for one, give him a hearty Amen.
