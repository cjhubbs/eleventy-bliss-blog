Some pieces worth a read:

[The Gospel Coalition asks: Should pastors separate the Christian wedding ceremony from the civil rite?](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2010/08/06/tgc-asks-should-pastors-separate-the-christian-wedding-ceremony-from-the-civil-rite/)

Three out of the four pastors interviewed say that yes, they think the civil / Christian disconnect will probably happen and that they are OK with it.

[A "Gospel" Response to California's Prop 8](http://www.jrdkirk.com/2010/08/12/gospel-response/)

> Each generation we look back in horror at the things that have been done in the past, taking refuge in the thought that, had we been there, we would have defied the majority and fought for what’s right. How easy retrospect is! ... And, every generation we are given a mirror in the issues of our own day to reflect back to us that, no, had we been alive we would have capitulated to power and injustice–would have refused to ask, “What does it mean to love my neighbor?”–just like those who came before us did.

[Letting Go - What should Medicine do when it can't save your life?](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/02/100802fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all)

[Why Conservatives Should Read Marx](http://www.thepointmag.com/archive/why-conservatives-should-read-marx/) - The Point Magazine

> When a family store goes under we blame “economic forces” as if there had been some kind of natural disaster. We think intervention would be unnatural, like old King Canute placing his throne on the beach and commanding the tide to halt. As Marx points out, however, even though the laws of capitalism do exist objectively in the sense that we cannot buck them–as a capitalist Joe has no choice but to increase productivity–that does not make them natural. They do not hold in tribal or feudal or monastic communities. Their objective reality is constituted by, and so dependent on, the institutions we have created and sustained–from the most basic transferrable property rights to the labyrinthine structure of interlocking laws and regulations undergirding our seemingly autonomous financial markets. To be truly conservative we would have to tame what we ourselves have let loose. Yet this seems a world away from the agenda of today’s conservatives. As John Stuart Mill lamented, “it is a melancholy truth, that if any measure were proposed, on any subject, truly, largely, and far-sightedly conservative, even if Liberals were willing to vote for it, the great bulk of the Conservative party would rush blindly in and prevent it from being carried.”
