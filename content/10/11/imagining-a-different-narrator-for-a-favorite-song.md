A couple of nights ago I had the classic Veggie Tales' Silly Song _Dance of the Cucumber_ pop into my head. (Don't even bother asking why.)

And after reciting a few lines, I had a wild idea pop into my head. Imagine if _Dance of the Cucumber_, instead of being interpreted by Bob the Tomato, were interpreted by...

... William Shatner.

Imagine his trademark delivery of the classic lines:

"Watch the cucumber... oh, how smooth his motion... like butter... on a bald... ...monkey."

"Listen to the cucumber... hear his strong voice... like a lion.. ...about to eat."

And the closing line of the verses: "dancing cucumber... dancing cucumber... dancing cucumber... dance, dance... YEAH."

Personally, I think it'd be awesome. The more I think about it, I wonder if Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki didn't have Shatner in mind when they did the song... but I may just be humoring myself with that thought.

What do you think?
