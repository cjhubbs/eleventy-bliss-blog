My reading queue has been backed up for a while now, and I'll admit that I only make things worse by buying books and regularly hitting the library. I've been entertaining myself with some light popular spy thrillers lately, but it's time to put those down and work through some better stuff. Here are a few that are in my pile:

[Sacred Unions, Sacred Passions: Engaging the Mystery of Friendship Between Men and Women](http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Unions-Passions-Engaging-Friendship/dp/0982580703%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0982580703) by Dan Brennan. [![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hXJjtdrRL._SL75_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Unions-Passions-Engaging-Friendship/dp/0982580703%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0982580703)

I had this one on my Amazon wishlist for a while after [John Armstrong wrote about it](http://johnharmstrong.typepad.com/john_h_armstrong_/2010/12/sacred-unions-sacred-passions-engaging-the-mystery-of-friendship-between-men-and-women.html). Becky bought it for me for Valentine's Day and it's been sitting in the pile ever since. The author's premise is that there is a meaningful place in the Christian life for close friendships between members of the opposite sex who are not married to each other. Typically this has been something that Christians have advised against, usually on the basis of wanting to protect marriage... but I'm interested in what the author has to say.

[Between Noon and Three: Romance, Law, and the Outrage of Grace](http://www.amazon.com/Between-Noon-Three-Romance-Outrage/dp/0802842224%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0802842224) by Robert Farrar Capon ![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mR2BZJ1hL._SL75_.jpg)

I got this one for Christmas and have already read it once, but it really merits a re-read and perhaps a blog post or two or three. This is a fascinating little book on grace, and there were two or three particular places in it that caught me square on and have gripped my thinking ever since. Definitely time for a re-read.

[Old Man's War](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765348276/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=scifirev-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0765348276) by John Scalzi. ![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zoTrszrsL._SL75_.jpg)

I don't even remember what blog I was reading that recommended this sci-fi novel, but the review was good, and the summary looked good, and the library had it... so it's in my queue. I do love me some sci-fi.

[Introverts in the Church: Finding Our Place in an Extroverted Culture](http://www.amazon.com/Introverts-Church-Finding-Extroverted-Culture/dp/0830837027%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0830837027) by Adam McHugh. [![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51elAktityL._SL75_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Introverts-Church-Finding-Extroverted-Culture/dp/0830837027%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0830837027)

This goes into the re-read category as well. I read things too quickly sometimes, and this was one that I buzzed through on the way to some other book. It deserves a more thoughtful re-read; there's a lot in it that could be very helpful to me and other introverts out there.

Well, enough for now. Any recommendations on other books I should add to the queue?
