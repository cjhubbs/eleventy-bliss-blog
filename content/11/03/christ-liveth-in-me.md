> As lives the flower within the seed, As in the cone the tree, So, praise the God of truth and grace, His Spirit dwelleth in me.

> _Christ liveth in me, Christ liveth in me, Oh! what a salvation this, That Christ liveth in me._

> \-- _[Christ Liveth in Me](http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/c/h/christli.htm)_, [Daniel Webster Whittle](http://www.cyberhymnal.org/bio/w/h/i/whittle_dw.htm), 1891

I'd never heard this hymn before this weekend, but it's a good one. Such a beautiful picture of what God does in the life of a believer.
