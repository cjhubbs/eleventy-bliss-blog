![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51elAktityL._SL160_.jpg)I've been doing a slow-and-steady re-read of [Adam McHugh's](http://www.introvertedchurch.com/) _[Introverts in the Church](http://www.amazon.com/Introverts-Church-Finding-Extroverted-Culture/dp/0830837027%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dchrishubbs-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0830837027)_, and words don't well express how much I resonate with what he is saying. Just as I read Dilbert and think that Scott Adams must've worked where I work to get it _that_ right, I read McHugh and think he must've served in the same churches I've served in. Amazing.

Last night I got to chapter 5, "Introverted Community and Relationships", and found a few paragraphs that were so apt that I couldn't resist sharing them.

> As introverts seek to enter into and participate in particular communities, their trajectory of commitment may take a different shape than that of their extroverted counterparts. extroverts, who want to increase their level of involvement, may proceed roughly in a straight line as they move from the periphery into the nucleus of the community. ... The journey of introverts into a community, however, is **better conceptualized as a spiral.** They take steps into a community, but then spiral out of it in order to regain energy, to reflect on their experiences and to determine if they are comfortable in that community. They move between entry, retreat and reentry, gradually moving deeper into the community on each loop.
> 
> The introverted path into community, much to the confusion of many extroverts, never reaches a point in which the spiraling form is shed.

You know how it feels when someone puts words to something that you've always felt and experienced but haven't been able to describe? That's how I feel when reading that passage. _That's_ what my pattern has been, or has needed to be, for the past 10 years.

Some more:

> An introverted college student I worked with...encountered several reactions when he chose to step outside of his community after two years of consistent participation. **Extroverted leaders chided him for his lack of commitment and were convinced that his pulling back was indicative of a larger spiritual problem infecting his heart.** The pastor of the community arranged meetings with him to understand what was happening and what was the source of his dissatisfaction with the group. **These efforts, as well intentioned as they were, only pushed him further away instead of drawing him back into his previous level of commitment.**

And yes, I've been there. And I'm thankful to be in a place now where that isn't happening.
