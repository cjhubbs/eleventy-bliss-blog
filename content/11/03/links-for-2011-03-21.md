Things I've linked recently:

- [Family Mealtime Prayers â€“ Justin Taylor](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2011/03/21/family-mealtime-prayers/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+between2worlds+(Between+Two+Worlds)&utm_content=Google+Reader)
    
    Thoughtful, learnable prayers from the Pipers.

    South Vietnamese Air Force Major lands a Cessna on the USS Midway. Great story.
    
- [WH forces P.J. Crowley to resign for condemning abuse of Manning - Glenn Greenwald - Salon.com](http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/03/13/crowley)
    
    "So, in Barack Obama's administration, it's perfectly acceptable to abuse an American citizen in detention who has been convicted of nothing by consigning him to 23-hour-a-day solitary confinement, barring him from exercising in his cell, punitively imposing "suicide watch" restrictions on him against the recommendations of brig psychiatrists, and subjecting him to prolonged, forced nudity designed to humiliate and degrade. But speaking out against that abuse is a firing offense."
    
    I am so disappointed with Obama right now.
