I _know_, if you ask me, that we've only gotten water in our basement due to rain twice, and those times were both before we installed a sump pump and after getting 8+ inches of rain inside of a week.

_Even still_, when the gentle early spring rain starts to fall tonight, my stomach tightens up and I start listening extra-close to try to hear if the water alarms are going off in the basement.

Sometimes I hate my brain.
