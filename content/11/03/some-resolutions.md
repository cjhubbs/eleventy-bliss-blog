In a week I'll turn 34, and begin my 35th year of life. That seems momentous somehow. For this 35th year, it's time to do a couple of blog-related things.

**First:** I'm abandoning the Tumblr blog. Not enough value to me to keep it. I'll make the effort to post links, pictures, and quotes in this space instead.

**Second:** I'm going to pick up [Kari](http://throughaglass.net/)'s [habit](http://throughaglass.net/archives/2011/03/01/good-things-in-february-2/) of keeping track of good things from every day of the month and doing a monthly post to capture them. They're great as a retrospective and should encourage gratefulness.

**Third:** I'm going to try to blog at least _something_ every week day. Need to get into the habit of writing more. We'll see how it goes.
