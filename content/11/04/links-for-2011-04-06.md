- [Who You Are, At Peace with God | Storied Theology](http://www.jrdkirk.com/2011/04/06/who-you-are-at-peace-with-god/)
    
    > So we need to change our internal monologues, and change the message to the body of Christ around us.
    > 
    > Stop beating yourself up: God loves you. Stop talking to yourself as if youâ€™re a stupid failure. You are embraced by God into the very person of his dearly beloved Son.
    > 
    > And stop talking to your children, and the children around you, and your pastor, and your parents, and your spouse, as if they are consistent failures. We must be to one another messengers of peace. And this, in turn, means being messengers of grace.
