We learned this one yesterday at Stonebridge. Great song for Palm Sunday and a well-formed, well-written song that I think will be sticking around for a while.

> Who, oh Lord, could save themselves, Their own soul could heal? Our shame was deeper than the sea Your grace is deeper still
> 
> You alone can rescue, You alone can save You alone can lift us from the grave You came down to find us, led us out of death To You alone belongs the highest praise
> 
> You, oh Lord, have made a way The great divide You heal For when our hearts were far away Your love went further still Yes, your love goes further still
> 
> You alone can rescue, You alone can save You alone can lift us from the grave You came down to find us, led us out of death To You alone belongs the highest praise To You alone belongs the highest praise To You alone belongs the highest praise
> 
> We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes You’re the Giver of Life We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes You’re the Giver of Life We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes You’re the Giver of Life We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes You’re the Giver of Life
> 
> You alone can rescue, You alone can save You alone can lift us from the grave You came down to find us, led us out of death To You alone belongs the highest praise To You alone belongs the highest praise To You alone belongs the highest praise
> 
> \-- _"You Alone Can Rescue" by Matt Redman_

This video is a little shaky and is missing the first verse, but it's a far sight better than the creepy one where Matt Redman and band are playing live on the 700 Club. \*shudder\*
