And it's a great bit of very nerdy coding humor. An excerpt:

> 2 Destructural Patterns
> 
> Below is a list of seven destructural patterns.
> 
> 2.1 Adopter
> 
> The Adopter Pattern provides a home for orphaned functions. The result is a large family of functions that don't look anything alike, whose only relation to one another is through the Adopter.
> 
> 2.2 Brig
> 
> The Brig Pattern is a container class for bad software. Also known as module.
> 
> 2.3 Compromise
> 
> The Compromise Pattern is used to balance the forces of schedule vs. quality. The result is software of inferior quality that is still late.

Awesome.
