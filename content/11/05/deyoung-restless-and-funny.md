Kevin DeYoung has [a post on parenting](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/05/10/parenting-001/) this morning that is _fantastic_. Funny, insightful, and encouraging. Well worth the time to read. But that's not really what I want to write about today.

Let me make a confession. The only reason I saw DeYoung's post is because it showed up as a shared item in Google Reader. Because I unsubscribed from his blog feed months ago. I've got 556 feeds subscribed at the moment, so I'm obviously not culling feeds to keep the post volume down. But I felt for a while like the only thing he was writing was strident, detailed defenses of young, restless, and reformed Calvinist theology. And I was getting very tired of reading them.

DeYoung's post this morning, though, struck me as very different. It's funny, practical, and insightful. When I read it instead of feeling like somebody was trying to shove neo-Calvinism down my throat I felt like I was being encouraged by a guy in a similar situation to me. I felt like Kevin might be the kind of guy that I would enjoy hanging out with and getting to know.

And then (I'm slow) it dawned on me: _he's probably been this way the whole time_. It's just my impression that's changed.

Which leads me to a larger question: are we aware of how our online appearance causes us to look to those who might read our stuff? And conversely, am I as a reader willing to remember that there is a fully-rounded person behind those words, even if he or she doesn't seem rounded online?

Now, I know there's a place for topical blogs, and I can infer from Kevin's decision to blog on The Gospel Coalition site that he's not shooting to have a free-for-all random blog. But there's value these days for anyone trying to be influential online to show a more well-rounded picture of who they are.

As I page back through DeYoung's recent blog posts, I have to confess he's being more well-rounded than I had previously given him credit for. (Whether this is a recent change or my selective memory is an issue I'll not try to resolve here.) While there are the expected [slew of book reviews](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/05/07/books-i-havent-read/), quotes of [Augustine](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/05/06/i-was-glad-to-weep-before-you/), [Jonathan Edwards](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/04/27/your-humility-should-be-hardly-discerned/), and [Tim Keller](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/04/21/are-you-looking-to-explore-christianity/), and [critiques of Rob Bell](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/04/26/love-wins-and-the-heidelberg-catechism-loses/), there is also [a video of Real Madrid's soccer trophy getting run over by a bus](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/04/26/there-must-be-a-sermon-illustration-here-somewhere/), [a collection of creepy Easter Bunny pictures](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/04/25/monday-morning-humor-59/), and [an Andrew Peterson song](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/04/23/the-silence-of-god-2/).

I guess this means this post is less of a critique of Kevin DeYoung and more of a _mea culpa_ for not keeping up with what all he's posted. It also means that you shouldn't be surprised if the next three posts on my blog are a cartoon, a nerdy musical reference, and something about programming. After all, that's pretty much how my brain goes. No sense in pretending otherwise.
