My music playlist is full of awesome this morning. (Thanks as usual to Geof for the playlist algorithms.) Here's the proof:

1. "Just As I Am" - Andrew Peterson, from _Love and Thunder_
2. "Saturday Sun" - Nick Drake, from _Five Leaves left_
3. "Winter Winds" - Mumford and Sons, from _Sign No More_
4. "Springtime Indiana" - Sandra McCracken, from _Gypsy Flat Road_
5. "Walkin' Home" - Billy Crockett, from _In These Days_
6. "Nobody's Fool" - Avril Lavigne, from _Let Go_
7. "Four Horses" - Andrew Osenga, from _Letters to the Editor, Vol. 2_
8. "Heaven Can Wait" - Charlotte Gainsbourg, from _IRM_
9. "Sad" - Eisley, from _The Valley_
10. "Please Be My Strength" - Gungor, from _Beautiful Things_
11. "Furr" - Blitzen Trapper, from _Furr_
12. "Blue Bayou" - Norah Jones and M. Ward, from _...Featuring_
13. "Alien Conspiracy, Or, The Cheese Song" - Andrew Peterson, from _Appendix A_

Within the next 15 upcoming, I've got Simon & Garfunkel, Derek Webb, Fleet Foxes, Leigh Nash, Ryan Adams, Coldplay, Adele, and Harry Connick. So good.
