Richard Beck has [a great piece today](http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2011/06/jesus-stopped-on-interruptibility.html) on interruptibility.

> Basically, interruptibility is a form of welcome and hospitality. It is a way of making room for others. This space we create is less a physical space than a _temporal_ space, making room in your To Do list, making space so we can slow down and pay attention to others.

Interruptibility is, he says, "a sign that we are moving at the speed of love." (What a great line!)

Beck goes on to explore some other traits that our interruptibility (or lack thereof) demonstrates. It's worth reading [the whole thing](http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2011/06/jesus-stopped-on-interruptibility.html).
