Andrew Jones (aka "Tall Skinny Kiwi"), "itinerant social entrepreneur", wandering missionary and prolific blogger, has a [hard but true, and dare I say, prophetic post](http://tallskinnykiwi.typepad.com/tallskinnykiwi/2011/08/the-nines-2011-pick-me.html) on his blog today. It's unfortunate that the piece is headlined as an appeal to be chosen to speak on [The Nines](http://thenines.leadnet.org/), because the bulk of the post is about the changes coming for the church and for Christian culture.

Did I mention it was a hard word? Here are just a few of his headline points:

- Church as we have known it is not the first option for the next generation. Neither is it an affordable option. It is not sustainable in the long term.
- Seminaries are in trouble.
- The Christian music industry as we have supported it, is over.
- The Christian publishing industry, as we have enjoyed it over our lifetime, is over.
- The church planting movement, in its ecclesiocentic and unholistic form, has played out its song and is now doing an unrequested encore.
- Prayer meetings are focused on making our outdated methods work better.

"If Americans want to play in the sandbox in global missions and sustainable holistic church ministry", says Jones, "then they need to listen to what the majority world is already discovering and implementing." He says that we can and should use this time of recession to re-orient and re-calibrate our thoughts on ministry and mission rather than just asking for more money.

You should [go read the piece](http://tallskinnykiwi.typepad.com/tallskinnykiwi/2011/08/the-nines-2011-pick-me.html) to hear his whole argument. Hard as it may be, I think Jones is right.
