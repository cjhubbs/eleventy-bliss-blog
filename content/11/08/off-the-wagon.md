So I had a Lipton diet green tea yesterday. The whole bottle had 30 mg of caffeine. From what I can tell, that's less than half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. Still, drinking that bottle of tea made me jittery for a couple of hours. Couldn't stop bouncing my legs. Craziness. I am now more motivated than ever to mostly stay away from the stuff.

On the other hand, I did my second 10-mile run yesterday and completed it with sub-10-mile pace and without feeling like I was going to die. I figure I need to do at least one more of those prior to the [New Bo Fest Half Marathon](http://www.newbofesthalfmarathon.com/) on September 4. Looking forward to that race... and to getting it done with.
