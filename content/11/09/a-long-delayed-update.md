So, that blogging every day thing didn't last long, did it? A little bit of work craziness and life busyness and all of a sudden it's been six weeks. So what's been going on? Since I last posted, I:

- Took a one-day trip to Montreal and back on the company jet for a dinner meeting
- Ran a [half-marathon](http://newbofesthalfmarathon.com/) in [2:07:25](http://newbofesthalfmarathon.com/BoFest_2011_Half%20Marathon_Overall.html)
- Got [runner's knee](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-241-285--7773-0,00.html) and had to avoid running for two weeks
- Traveled to St. Louis for [the FAA's National Software and Airborne Electronic Hardware Conference](http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/conference/) and took the family along
- Went on from St. Louis to Nashville and helped [Andy Osenga](http://www.andrewosenga.com) [build](http://andrewosenga.com/blog/2011/9/16/building-day-1.html) a [space](http://andrewosenga.com/blog/2011/9/20/building-day-2.html) [ship](http://andrewosenga.com/blog/2011/9/21/spaceship-concert.html)
- While in Nashville, got to hang out with the estimable [Geof Morris](http://www.gfmorris.com), [Mike Terry](http://www.facebook.com/michaelaterry), and [Josh Stockment](http://www.facebook.com/stockment)
- Also while in Nashville, went on a quick jaunt with Geof down to Huntsville, AL to meet [Stephen and Misty Granade](http://granades.com/), who were even more awesome than I expected them to be.
- After meeting Stephen, caught up on all 9 existing episodes of his quite hilarious podcast _[Disasterpiece Theatre](http://disasterpiece-theatre.com/)_.
- Developed and rolled out a [new website project](http://www.cornerstone-marion.org)
- Got a new [27" iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/)
- Started piano lessons for my oldest daughter

So yeah. I'm still struggling with how to best pull together the content that I share every day via Google Reader, Google+, and Twitter. I'd like to be able to centralize it here... but I haven't managed to work that into my process yet. I'll keep trying.
