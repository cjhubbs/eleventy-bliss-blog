Far down in the comments on [an excellent post on cross-gender friendships](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/women/2011/10/were_just_friends_no_really_1.html) (which is worth reading in its' own right) is [this paragraph by commenter Andrew](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/women/2011/10/were_just_friends_no_really_1.html#comment-554854):

> ...I love the stories of Jesus. As you probably know, he is always telling people to leave their work, their money, their families--all the things tied to very worldly desires, ones often thought to be fixed into the very nature of what it means to be human. Jesus steps between those narratives that seek to tell us what our nature is, and he tells us to leave it all to follow him. "Not that," he says, "Me." "Don't worry about that," he says, "I'll take care of it."

What a great expression of Jesus' promise of provision as he calls us to unreservedly follow him.
