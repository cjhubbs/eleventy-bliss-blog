I realize after writing these last couple of posts that they may make me sound like I'm deeply unhappy or unsatisfied with my current church. Given that lots of my local church friends read my blog, let me assure you that it's not the case. I'm happy with where we are as a church. I'm encouraged and challenged by the teaching on a regular basis. I enjoy serving as a part of our music team. I've made some good friends in the three years we've been at Stonebridge, and I know those relationships will only deepen as time goes on.

We're also involved in a community group (which is a new addition for us this year). It's possible that as we get to know our group better it will serve as some of the fellowship I'm looking for. But those relationships take time to grow. We'll see how it goes. And I'm also enthusiastic about the spiritual goals that our church leadership has set out for us this year. They're good ones. We just have to follow through on them and make them more than just words.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if I get an email from my pastor sometime within the next week saying "hey man, read your blog, anything we can talk about? How can we minister to you better?" I love my pastor deeply and greatly appreciate the fact that he will notice it and be faithful as a shepherd to get with me and see what's up.

But here's the thing. I don't think that what I'm looking for is someone or some group to minister to me in a way that I've been missing. What I'm looking for is a community of believers who can join, side by side, in agreement that we are all broken and in need of the Gospel to minister to us on a daily basis.

\[My apologies: 300+ words is hardly a quick clarification. _sigh_\]
