After fleshing it out a bit, I present this equation for the Time Remaining until Halloween Lights Out:

![](http://chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/CodeCogsEqn.gif "CodeCogsEqn")

Where Cr = Candy remaining Cd = Amount of leftover candy desired Tf = Time you'll shut down, regardless Tc = Current Time Vn = Time of the last trick-or-treater Vn-1 = Time of the trick-or-treater before that

The zeroes of the equation are in all the right places; however, some constants may need to be scattered around in order to make a really practical application.

All it needs now is a snappy name.
