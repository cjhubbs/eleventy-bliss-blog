[Karibeth Baumann](http://throughaglass.net/) has spent November blogging letters to her young son Atticus. [She finishes up today](http://throughaglass.net/archives/2011/11/30/dear-atticus-a-love-letter/) with a beautiful summary that captures something of the revelation that parenting is:

> A few years ago, I was hanging out with some other women who were doing the thing where they complain about their husbands. Afterwards, one of them said to me that she noticed that I don’t complain about your dad. Which is true. I don’t talk about him dismissively or roll my eyes at him (except maybe when he makes a terrible joke). I enjoy spending time with him, and I try to take an interest in things that are important to him.
> 
> But for some reason, Atticus, I didn’t realize that I would feel the same way about you. I thought you would be a kid, and I am not so interested in kids. I am sorry, sweet boy, that I wasn’t more excited about you joining our family. I didn’t know you would be a person. I didn’t know you would be _you_. If I had known how bright and funny and wild you were going to be, I would have been so much more excited to meet you.

I have a friend who, every time that we were expecting a child, would say "I can't wait to meet him/her". The first time I heard it, it sounded a little weird to me. But getting to know the amazing people that your children _already are_ is one of the great unexpected (at least to me) joys of parenting.

Kari's whole month of letters is well worth the read.
