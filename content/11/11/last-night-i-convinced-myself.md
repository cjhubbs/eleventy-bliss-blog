Last night I convinced myself that I wanted to hit the gym this morning. I packed my bag so I could just go from the gym to work, and then psyched myself up for making sure I got up with my alarm.

Trouble is, I psyched myself up so much that then I slept restlessly all night because I was afraid I was going to miss my alarm. _\*sigh\*_

Well, at least I'm up with my alarm and headed for the gym. I'll be paying for this about 8:00 tonight when I can't keep my eyes open...
