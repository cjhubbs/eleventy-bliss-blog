My friend [Geof](http://gfmorris.com) has been writing a series of "letters" blog posts this month, addressed to family and friends. I'll admit to idly wondering whether I'd rate a letter or not, but when I saw ["Dear Chris"](http://gfmorris.com/2011/11/16/dear-chris/) show up in my RSS reader, and then read his post, I was a little bit challenged to know what to say.

One of these days I'm going to return the favor and distill my thoughts into a letter/blog post for Geof, but for now I'll just say that I'm blessed to be able to count him as a friend, and that I wish there was a way we could merge the awesomeness that is Geof's Huntsville, AL, crowd with my Iowa-based career path.
