Dutch illustrator Tineke Meirink has a nifty site called [stop:watch](http://www.stop-watch.nl/) where she takes the mundane and makes it magical. Starting with photos of everyday places and items, she then uses Photoshop to add in "what she sees". For example:

**Before:** ![Before](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wKSp3fFK1n4/Ty0Z0pAnX7I/AAAAAAAAAgw/AA6bdc-6CTM/s640/DSC_5762_kl.jpg)

**After:** ![After](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RqYlB7WEkW4/Ty5sMcu6RwI/AAAAAAAAAhA/VbOuhXCwpP8/s640/Hnnngggh!_kl.jpg)

She has a whole library of similar illustrations, and I spent a good while with my older two daughters yesterday looking through them. They would study the "before" picture, then squeal with delight as they searched the "after" picture and found the changes (which sometimes were fairly subtle).

As I got to thinking about it later on, it occurred to me that these illustrations are a great picture of God's work in our lives. In Philippians 1:6, Paul says he is confident that "He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion..."

What God has in mind for me (and for each of us) could be likened to how Tineke Meirink sees these photographs. We may only see the "before" picture, the thoughtless mess of paint splatter or bird droppings. But God has the whole thing in mind, and will be working in our lives to bring it about - making a final picture that is not only beautiful but that uniquely transforms the original mess.

I'm also challenged that I need to look at others this way; where others see the mess, I need to have eyes to see the beauty that can be revealed by God's work in that person's life. In God's hands, even your bird poop can be transformed for His glory.
