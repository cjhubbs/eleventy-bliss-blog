After recently finishing N. T. Wright's _Simply Jesus_, I've been thinking again on Wright's view of the church's work as inaugurating the Kingdom of God here on the earth. Even though we know it won't come into perfection until Jesus' return, Wright says, is no excuse that we shouldn't start working on it now. I love this bit of reasoning from Wright's _Surprised by Hope_:

> What would you say to someone who said, rightly, that God would make them completely holy in the resurrection and that they would never reach this state of complete holiness until then - and who then went on to say, wrongly, that therefore there was no point in even trying to live a holy life until that time? You would press for some form of inaugurated eschatology. You would insist that the new life of the Spirit, in obedience to the lordship of Jesus Christ, should produce a radical transformation of behavior in the present life, _anticipating_ the life to come...  
> <br/> 
> ...Apply the same to Romans 8! How do you answer someone who says, rightly, that the world will not be completely just and right until the new creation and who deduces, wrongly, that there is no point trying to bring justice to the world... until that time? \[I\]nsist on inaugurated eschatology, on a radical transformation of the way we behave as a worldwide community, _anticipating_ the eventual time when God will be all in all even though we agree things won't be complete until then.

The analogy that's been rattling around in my head in this election year is of the people of God as a political advance team. Say that you're the supporter of a candidate that you _know_ is ultimately going to win. Your work as part of the advance team is to get the word out - in hopes that others will join the team, and to get the groundwork done so that things are ready when the winner finally shows up. Then, when the new ruler is in place, the people that were on his side the whole time are the ones who are rewarded - with good things from the kingdom and with places of responsibility.

So, too, in many ways with the kingdom. We _know_ who the ultimate 'winner' and coming ruler is. He has already conquered death and is the prototype of the new creation. But until He comes to set up his complete rule, we are here, spreading the word. Jesus is Lord. We're doing as much ground work as He enables us to do. 1 Cor 15 says that 'our works are not in vain in the Lord'. Those works have a purpose. And when Jesus finally does return, it's not a stretch to the understanding that ruling and reigning with Christ may be something akin to the leadership positions and ambassadorships that come today to the early and long-time supporters of a new ruler.

So... get the word out. Get people on the team. Get the work started. Wait expectantly. Come soon, Lord Jesus.
