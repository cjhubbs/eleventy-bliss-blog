My friend Andy Osenga has a [new record available to purchase (download or physical CD) today over on the Rabbit Room store](https://store.rabbitroom.com/index.php?/product/leonard-the-lonely-astronaut).

Leonard the Lonely Astronaut is quite a concept. Leonard is off on a solo intergalactic space flight, and while he's traversing the galaxy he's writing songs. We build a rocket ship set for Andy to record this thing in. It was awesome. The record has turned out awesome as well.

Ten bucks gets you the mp3 downloads today. Don't wait long, though, because in a few days it's going back into the AO vault until its official release in the fall.

_Leonard the Lonely Astronaut is rated A for AWESOME. No space rocks were harmed in the making of this blog post. This author did not receive any compensation for writing this post other than the satisfaction of plugging a friend's record. In fact, this author is still waiting for the t-shirt that is coming with the Kickstarter pledge. Pictures to follow._
