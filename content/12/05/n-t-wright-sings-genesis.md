Monday night I had the privilege of meeting Bishop N. T. Wright and hearing him speak in Nashville, TN. I've written about it for 800 words over at the BHT, so I won't repeat that here.

After his talk and some Q&A he was pressed to pick up a guitar, and the second song he sang was this one. The story is that he was bored during a conference and so wrote these lyrics about Genesis to the tune of "Yesterday". [Francis Collins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins) (brilliant scientist, Christian, and currently director of the National Institutes of Health) made some tweaks to them and (as the story goes) they sang this song at a [BioLogos](http://biologos.org/) conference in New York.

Sorry for the lousy video quality; the sound is good, though.
