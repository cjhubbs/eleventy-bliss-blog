Years ago when my family first got a VCR and started renting movies, my dad made a beeline for all of the Rocky and Bullwinkle titles he could find. And for good cause: they are full of the corny jokes and clever puns that my family's humor has revolved around for years.

(Today all the Rocky & Bullwinkle episodes are [available to stream on Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends). But I digress.)

Out of all the amazing and lame and cheesy puns and jokes from Rocky and Bullwinkle, there was one that has stuck with me to the point that I now use it in every day conversation. The joke goes something like this:

> **Bullwinkle:** Twenty dollars?!? That's antihistamine money! **Rocky:** Antihistamine money? **Bullwinkle:** Yes. It's not to be sneezed at. Get it? Not to be sneezed at? **Rocky:** I get it. **Bullwinkle:** Thousands won't.

So there you go.

**Antihistamine money.**

You're welcome.
