...is that I start blogging _about_ blogging, and I start thinking more about how I'm going to modify my blog layout/structure/etc than what I'm going to write about next.

That being said, I've been tempted lately to mess around with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), spin a simple layout/theme of my own, and convert this site to a static site driven by text file inputs.

But if I'm honest with myself, I know that my blog doesn't get so much traffic that making it static actually matters performance-wise, and I might not even like the blogging process as much when I change it up. I'm really just interested in the setup and conversion process.

I think I need to find something more productive to work on.
