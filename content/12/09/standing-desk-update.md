It's been a little over a month since [I began using a standing desk at work](/12/08/standing-up-at-my-desk/).

So how's it going after a month? Pretty well, actually. Some observations:

- My back, arms, and shoulders are a lot less sore at the end of each day. I'm tall (6-4) and squishing myself under a desk all day just wasn't good form. Standing up is a lot better.
- My legs are slowly getting used to it. The first day I stood up all day I was _definitely_ ready to get off my feet at the end of the day.
- I got a standing mat that helped a lot. Having 3/4-inch of foam between my feet and the floor really helps.
- I learned really quick which shoes are comfortable (my [Merrell Road Gloves](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SOLLFG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005SOLLFG&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20) are _awesome_) and which ones are not (my cheap black dress shoes).
- My co-workers were amused, interested, and curious. I don't know that any of them will take up the trend, but many of them observed that it might be a nice change. (It's also possible they were just being polite and really think that I'm a weirdo.)

I'm planning on sticking with the standing desk for the time being. If I'm still gung-ho about it after, say, Christmas, I might start pursuing the possibility of getting a real standing desk via the regular work channels. I understand they have one that is electric and adjustable, which would be nice. It'd also be nice to bring all of my work surface (not just my monitors and keyboard) up to standing level.
