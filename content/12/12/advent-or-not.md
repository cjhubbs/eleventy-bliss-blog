'Tis the season of Advent, or at least lots of church bloggers are telling me. A time of anticipation, longing, and waiting. Even evangelical churches that aren't big on use of the church calendar seem to mark out the time for Advent.

It's curious in a way. We evangelicals don't observe much of the rest of the traditional church calendar. Christmas? That's a single day. (That 12 Days of Christmas song is just some weird anachronism.) Pentecost? We remember the story, but don't mark the day. Lent? Heck no, that's a weird Catholic thing. Ascension? Is that even a thing we remember?

The churches I grew up in didn't follow the church calendar, so the only taste I got of it was when visiting my grandparents' Lutheran church on occasion. _17th Sunday after Pentecost? What the what?_ It's not until this past decade as I've gained friends in more liturgical denominations that my awareness has been heightened to the greater observance of the calendar. ([Kari](http://throughaglass.net), for instance, has done some lovely posts on [Advent](http://throughaglass.net/archives/2012/12/02/advent-i-preparing/), [Lent](http://throughaglass.net/archives/2012/02/29/habits/), and [Ordinary Time](http://throughaglass.net/archives/2009/06/11/an-elephants-faithful-one-hundred-percent/).)

Seeing how the larger church observes the calendar helps me understand some of the celebrational whiplash that I feel throughout the year. _Why do they do Lent for 40 days but then Easter is just one day? Oh, Easter is actually supposed to be celebrated longer than just the day? \*lightbulb\*_

It also helps me explain the dissonance I felt on the first Sunday in December when our church worship kicked off with _Angels We Have Heard on High_. (It was assuaged briefly this past week when we opened with _O Come, O Come, Emmanuel_, but quickly returned when we closed the service with _Joy to the World!_.)

Don't get me wrong - I love the Christmas hymns. But it does feel like we miss something when we bypass all the anticipation and spread our Jesus-is-born celebration across the whole month of December.

Could it be that the anticipation of Advent is the tension that stretches the boundary between heaven and earth so thin that when we finally do reach Christmas Eve, our hearts can glimpse heaven breaking through?

At the end of Sally Lloyd-Jones' beautiful _[Jesus Storybook Bible](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310708257/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0310708257&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20)_, she writes about the revelation to John, and she says this:

> One day, John knew, Heaven would come down and mend God's broken world and make it our true, perfect home once again.
> 
> And he knew, in some mysterious way that would be hard to explain, that everything was going to be more wonderful for once having been so sad.

In the same way, Advent makes Christmas more wonderful, if only because the heightened anticipation makes us keenly ready to celebrate Jesus' birth.

Let us anticipate together His coming.
