For at least twenty years my mother has been requesting that I record some of my piano stylings. For one reason and another I've never gotten to it, until now. My mom got her copy last weekend when we celebrated Christmas with my side of the family, so now I'm free and clear to share it with you all. I'm calling it [_Carols for Christmas_](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/udiadekdc99akc6/AADzppw1KdFczRFiZaEZoU5Ea?dl=0).

It's just over 30 minutes worth of music, all piano versions of traditional Christmas carols. There's not a lot in the way of production - I recorded them using my Casio midi controller keyboard in single takes in GarageBand and did a minimal amount of editing to remove the clunky notes. The perfectionist part of me wishes I had another 80 hours to really refine and polish the arrangements and recordings; the engineer in me has declared "good enough". The engineer won the debate this time.

So please enjoy _Carols for Christmas_ as my gift to you this season. This [download link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/udiadekdc99akc6/AADzppw1KdFczRFiZaEZoU5Ea?dl=0) will let you listen and/or download MP3s from Dropbox.

Merry Christmas!
