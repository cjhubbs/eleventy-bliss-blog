Half the folks from BHT will probably post this, but it's so good that I'm going to post it as well.

[Pastor Rod Rosenbladt's recent sermon as a conversation between a sinner and God.](http://www.newreformationpress.com/blog/nrp-freebies/gift/)

> Sinner: You mean I had no part? God: Your sin was your part. Sinner: But my faith, my devotion, my Christian life are not? God: All of those suck.

Boom.
