So, that guy who [complained earlier this week](http://chrishubbs.com/2013/01/07/on-playing-and-variety/) that he was getting a little bored or stale playing keys?

Well, he went to worship band practice this morning and found out that the drummer had called in sick. And while there are drum tracks that can be enabled for most of the songs, there's one that conspicuously needs a live drummer.

Guess who's going to be heading in to church extra-early in the morning to practice?

Here's hoping he doesn't end up sounding awful. The band deserves better.
