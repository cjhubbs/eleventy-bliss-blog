My primary instrument has always been (and likely always will be) keys of some sort. I started piano lessons when I was 7. I started playing for church at age 14. I first started playing with a church worship band in college at age 19. I've led worship while playing the piano hundreds of times. Those fingers on the keys at the top of my blog are my fingers, playing piano at my sister's wedding.

Back in high school I taught myself to play guitar, and I'm a reasonable hack there, though my fingerings are never very clean. From there I did a lot of playing bass lines on the guitar, though I've only played bass as part of a band a handful of times. Keys are where it's at for me. And that's worked to fill the need where I've been. After college there haven't been an abundance of other keyboardists.

For the last year or so, though, while I love playing keys in the worship band, the instruments that are in my head all the time, the ones I dream about playing, are bass and drums. I'm not sure why. Maybe because so much of the music I listen to is guitar/bass/drums driven instead of piano-driven? Maybe I'm just getting bored with piano right now?

In reality, I'm a passable bass player. I can keep tempo on the drums, but one listen to a _real_ drummer (of which we have several at church) quickly reminds me that I'm just a hack. (Of course, I have no practice... maybe I'd pick it up quickly?)

I don't know where this leaves me or even really what my conclusion is. It's just odd to observe that after having piano ingrained in my brain for almost 30 years, I'm now doing a lot of my primary thinking in terms of other instruments. (It's suppose it's also entirely possible that piano is just _so_ ingrained that I don't notice it any more.)
