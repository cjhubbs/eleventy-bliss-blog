[Sarah Clarkson](http://www.thoroughlyalive.com/) has a [beautiful post over on The Rabbit Room](http://www.rabbitroom.com/2013/03/jack-quinns-for-joy/) today about, as she says, "the grave importance" of celebrations, and how they remind us that God cares for our joy - not just the joy that we find from spiritual hope in the midst of trouble, but also in the fully-embodied, rollicking joy of song, food, and friendship.

> Satan, I think, strikes a few of his best blows when he can persuade us that God is boring. That life with our Savior is a dull and dutiful upward climb toward a summit of righteousness always a little out of reach. We are close to defeat when we start to believe that God cares nothing for joy, that holy people are wage slaves to long days of righteousness. Work, pray, endure, and pay your bills, check off that list of upright deeds. And the image of God in our weary minds becomes that of a long-faced master whose only concern is our efficient goodness. We forget that we are called to a King who laughs and creates, sings and saves. That our end is a kingdom crammed with our heartâ€™s desires. We forget that our God is the Lord of the dance and the one whose new world begins with a feast.
