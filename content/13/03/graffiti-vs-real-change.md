[Matt Chambers has a piece up today](https://ethoshift.squarespace.com/ethoshift-1/4cintbue7cox8sczeoizn5bk6bul0k) in light of this week's ongoing arguments about gay marriage, and this paragraph jumped right off the screen:

> As it is, we, as Christians / Christ-followers / Believers / Born Agains / _\[insert latest trendy religious title here\]_, seem to be much more comfortable trying to find a way to use all our energies up in plastering the kingdoms of the world with graffiti that says, "heaven" than actually pouring ourselves out to see God's will on earth as it is in heaven.  
> <br/>
> Trouble is, graffiti doesn't fool anyone.

Boom.
