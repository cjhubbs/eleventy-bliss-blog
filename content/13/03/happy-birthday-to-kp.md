It's March, which means the birthdays come fast and furious at the Hubbs house. Today the youngest member of our household isn't quite so young. Katie P turns 4 today! This little sweetie never slows down for long... guess that's what happens when you have two big sisters to keep up with.

Today we will celebrate with lunch at her favorite place... nuggets (and maybe ice cream!) at Chick-Fil-A.
