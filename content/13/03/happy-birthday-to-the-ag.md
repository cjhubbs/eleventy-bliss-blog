Seven years ago today, in the dark of the early morning, Addison was born. This young lady is so special... a free spirit in a house full of engineers who has a built-in wiggle that won't let her sit still when there's music going.

She's wildly creative (that's a 'boom box' she created) and has the most delicious random thoughts. (The other day: "Mom, if you return library books early, does the library pay _you_ money?")

Hard to believe this awesome girl is now seven years old. We love you Addie Grace!
