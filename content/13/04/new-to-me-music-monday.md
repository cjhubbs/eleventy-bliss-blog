We made a family trip to the library yesterday, and as usual I came home with a pile of books and media beyond what I am ever to get through in the three weeks I'm allowed to borrow them. I did, however, manage to work my way through the four new (to me) CDs that I borrowed.

In the order I listened to them at work today:

_[Loaded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_(The_Velvet_Underground_album))_ - The Velvet Underground.

I'd never listened to The Velvet Underground before today. I found them enjoyable in that early 1970's rock-and-roll way. Nothing too profound, but very listenable.

_[Chamber Music Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_Music_Society)_ - Esperanza Spalding.

Jazz, anybody? Spalding is another new artist to me, and wowza. The woman plays bass and holy cow can she sing. Fantastic jazz. This one is a keeper.

_[Live at Leeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_Leeds)_ - The Who.

I'm typically a fan of live records, but this one didn't really grab me. Maybe I'm not enough of an aficionado of The Who. I dunno. Turned this one off about four tracks in. Really couldn't bring myself to care.

_[Vampire Weekend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Weekend_(album))_ - Vampire Weekend.

I've owned Vampire Weekend's _Contra_ for a couple of years now and enjoy it OK. But when I heard my friend [Dan](http://okaywhatever.com/) complain a while back (on some social media - can't remember which or when) that he hated _Contra_ and hoped that VW's new record would be more like their older stuff, I took a mental note to explore their other stuff.

And (no real surprise here) Dan was right. This eponymous record is, on first listen, far superior to _Contra_. Less frantic, more interesting melodies and instrumentations. I wish they wouldn't drop the F-bomb - makes it less friendly for playing when the kids are around - but on the whole, yeah, this one bears multiple listens as well.

Thus ends Chris's random update on new (to me) music.
