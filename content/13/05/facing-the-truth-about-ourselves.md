Andrew Peterson has [a beautiful piece up at The Rabbit Room](http://www.rabbitroom.com/2013/05/facing-the-truth/) today. He reflects on his discomfort at answering personal questions on a doctor's questionnaire, and the dichotomy between what he _wants to think he is_ and what he _actually is_.

> But you see, the story we tell ourselves is skewed. There comes a time when we need to sit and take account of how we’re spending our lives, like at the doctor’s office or with the budget, and be reminded that we are not who we think we are. We need Jesus more than we allow ourselves to admit. We are not really so much better than the people around us whose lives are so obviously messy. In fact, we’re not better at all. They may in fact be closer to the heart of Jesus because they are humble enough to admit to themselves that they need help, humble enough to answer the hard questions about their weakness boldly.

You should really read [the whole thing](http://www.rabbitroom.com/2013/05/facing-the-truth/).
