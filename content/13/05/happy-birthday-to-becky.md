Today is my dear wife's birthday. We're probably getting to the point where she doesn't appreciate me listing her age any more, but suffice it to say I'll always be a couple months older than she is.

We're old enough now that we've known each other for half of our lives, and I can't quite imagine my life without her. Best friend, awesome mom for our three daughters, faithful friend to those around her, tireless servant. I am well and truly blessed.

It's only typical that we will spend her birthday primarily celebrating others. (Let's face it: it's graduation season.) But with her mom visiting and three excited little girls, we won't let the day go by without making sure we celebrate her, too.
