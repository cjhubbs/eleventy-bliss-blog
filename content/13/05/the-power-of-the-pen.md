I like writing by hand, and I love the feel of writing with a good pen. In my experience, though, good pens are hard to find.

Several years ago I decided I wanted to give fountain pens a try. While I enjoyed the character that the fountain nib added to my writing, I always had a couple of issues: first, I could never get consistent ink flow through the nib. (Maybe I just wasn't willing to spend enough on a pen? The [Lamy Safari](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T401Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002T401Y&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20) is usually spoken of highly, though.)

Second, my handwriting tends to be small, which means I value thin, precise lines. Not so easy with a fountain pen. (I keep a [Pilot Varsity disposable fountain pen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UXM3B4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002UXM3B4&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20) around for signing things at work. My signature: not so small.)

Then I found the [Uniball Signo gel ink pens](http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.38-mm-Blue-Black/pd/304), which are awesome. (I prefer the 0.38 mm width.) Unfortunately, they're not sold directly in the US; I splurge every year or so and order a few from JetPens.com, which imports them from Asia.

Then last week somebody linked to and highly recommended the [Parker Jotter ballpoint retractable pen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001603YXI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001603YXI&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20). This little gem is stainless steel, refillable, and a little smaller than your normal sized pen; all winners as far as I was concerned.

Then I found out it was the pen used as James Bond's exploding pen in Goldeneye, and that sealed the deal. (I'm a sucker for Goldeneye for some reason.) The video here is queued up for maximum clicky-ness. (Unfortunately I was unable to find one that ran long enough to get computer hacker Boris's final, exultant cry of "I am invincible!".)

And friends, the pen sounds _exactly like that_ when I click it. Which is awesome. (Come back in a week to find out if I've completely annoyed my wife with the clicking yet.)
