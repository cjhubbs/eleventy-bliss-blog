We had a bunch of family visit our home the past couple days, including my grandmother, my parents, and two siblings. Such fun to have so many of us together. (And those that weren't here were sorely missed.)

As one bit of evidence to document the weekend, here are four generations of family (my grandma, my dad, my sister, and my oldest two daughters) playing Apples to Apples. Grandma had never played before, but she pretty well cleaned up.
