I realize that everyone reading this has already either made a decision on a Google Reader replacement, or just had their eyes glaze over when I said "Google Reader replacement", which means this post is probably unnecessary. But still, I want to take a second to sing the praises of [NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com).

NewsBlur is an RSS reader developed and maintained by one guy, [Samuel Clay](http://www.samuelclay.com/). He was working on it long before Google announced that they were killing Reader, and when that announcement came out he managed to scale up his reader from supporting a couple thousand users to, at current count, over 20,000.

Not only is the tool nice to look at and snappy, but Samuel's support is fantastic. I filed a help ticket yesterday morning complaining about a reload that wasn't working, and by last night he had it fixed. It seems even snappier today, which is awesome.

I'm not opposed to paying for services I find useful, and I'm quite happy to be a premium user of NewsBlur and throw a few bucks Samuel's way on a regular basis. Here's hoping that NewsBlur continues to succeed long-term, and that other developers follow Samuel's lead in creating great services.
