It's Friday headed in to a holiday weekend and I'm tired of writing about serious topics, so it's time to share this video - a 6-minute PBS feature on mandolin player extraordinaire Chris Thile.

Thile, only 32 years old but long known for his bluegrass/folk/Americana, has recently released [an album of Bach Sonatas and Partitas played on the mandolin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3NSYEE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00E3NSYEE&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20). As you'll see in the video - he's fantastic, and Bach's music translates remarkably well.

This album is [available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3NSYEE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00E3NSYEE&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20) and probably lots of other places. I picked it up this morning and I'm looking forward to spending some time with it over the weekend.
