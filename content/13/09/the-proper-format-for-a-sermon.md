A good insight here:

> ...a genuine sermon must begin with the first proclamation, with the proclamation of salvation. There is nothing more solid, deep and sure than this proclamation. Then you have to do catechesis. Then you can draw even a moral consequence. **But the proclamation of the saving love of God comes before moral and religious imperatives.** Today sometimes it seems that the opposite order is prevailing.

You've gotta love this.

First proclaim the gospel, the truth of God's love and salvation.

Then do your doctrinal teaching.

Then draw a "moral consequence" - the "what to do".

But get the order right.

This is just one piece of the wisdom from Pope Francis, as documented in [this recently-published interview](http://www.americamagazine.org/pope-interview). It's long, but a remarkable and highly-recommended read.
