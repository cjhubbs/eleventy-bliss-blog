When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my childrenâ€™s lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.

\--"The Peace of Wild Things" by Wendell Berry
