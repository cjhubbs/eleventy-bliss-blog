It's been fun as my daughter Laura gets older (almost 9 and a half!) seeing her start to use things like instant messaging to great effect. A year ago she started trying to impersonate her mother while IMing me. (I caught on quickly. Becky doesn't usually have typos.) A year later, she's a lot better at the impersonation. (And has a lot fewer typos.)

I totally cracked up tonight when I saw the result of a Skype chat she had with my brother Ryan (who lives in London, England) earlier today. Ryan is well known for his silliness, and Laura comes by it honestly herself. Here's the result:

I now know I must employ a sizable number of ninja warriors next time I make a cup of coffee and Laura's around.
