I'm sure I heard the name [Marilynne Robinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilynne_Robinson) several years ago when her novel _Gilead_ won the Pulitzer Prize. She does live just down the road in Iowa City, after all. As I recall I even borrowed the book from the library and got bogged down in it pretty quickly. (Maybe I wasn't ready for it a decade ago.)

Then last year on a whim I borrowed _When I Was A Child I Read Books_ from the library; a slim volume of essays that turned into [one of my favorite reads of the year](http://chrishubbs.com/2012/08/15/when-i-was-a-child-i-read-books-by-marilynne-robinson/). (I need to go back and read it again.)

Robinson's writing reveals her as a delightful conundrum theologically. Raised Presbyterian, now part of the United Church of Christ, yet rather than embracing the theological ambiguity of the UCC she speaks fondly of John Calvin, clearly takes the Scriptures seriously, and reveals a deep humanism and care for people created in God's image.

[A recent interview of Robinson by The American Conservative](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/christian-not-conservative/) prompted me to write this post, and it's definitely worth a read. Robinson stakes her claim to 'liberal Protestantism' that she describes as being 'grounded in Calvinism'.

When asked her thoughts about the association of Christianity with the American right-wing, she said this:

> Well, what is a Christian, after all? Can we say that most of us are defined by the belief that Jesus Christ made the most gracious gift of his life and death for our redemption? Then what does he deserve from us? He said we are to love our enemies, to turn the other cheek. Granted, these are difficult teachings. But does our most gracious Lord deserve to have his name associated with concealed weapons and stand-your-ground laws, things that fly in the face of his teaching and example? Does he say anywhere that we exist primarily to drive an economy and flourish in it? He says precisely the opposite. Surely we all know this. I suspect that the association of Christianity with positions that would not survive a glance at the Gospels or the Epistles is opportunistic, and that if the actual Christians raised these questions those whose real commitments are to money and hostility and potential violence would drop the pretense and walk away.

Strong stuff. And I love the spirit of what she says when asked about her views of the Second Coming:

> I expect to be very much surprised by the Second Coming. I would never have imagined the Incarnation or the Resurrection. To be astonishing seems to be the mark of God’s great acts—who could have imagined Creation? On these grounds it seems like presumption to me to treat what can only be speculation as if it were even tentative knowledge. I expect the goodness of God and the preciousness of Creation to be realized fully and eternally. I expect us all to receive a great instruction in the absolute nature of grace.

I went to the library yesterday and picked up a copy of _Gilead_. It's time to give it another try. Then it's time to go back and find Robinson's other novels and essays. We are blessed to have a thinker and writer of Robinson's grace and skill sharing with us.
