From Marilynne Robinson's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel _[Gilead](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031242440X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=031242440X&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20)_:

> I'm not saying never doubt or question. The Lord gave you a mind so that you would make honest use of it. I'm saying you must be sure that the doubts and questions are your own, not, so to speak, the mustache and walking stick that happen to be the fashion of any particular moment.

Sage advice, that.
