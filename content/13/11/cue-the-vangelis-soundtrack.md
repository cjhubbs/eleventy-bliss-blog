One of the enjoyable things about going on business trips to various locations is the chance to get to do some running in locations I don't usually get to see. I love that running gives you a perspective on a place that you don't get from just driving past in your car, and when you can get that perspective on someplace new, that's a treat.

A couple of past favorites include a run around Washington, DC, and another one in Ottawa, Ontario with a short excursion into Quebec. Tonight, though, I got to do my best _Chariots of Fire_ impression on the beach outside of Melbourne, Florida. Can't beat the sound of waves crashing on the shore as accompianament for your run.

I had to cut the run short because it was getting dark fast, but it was a great run; will definitely have to hit the beach this way again on my next trip to Florida.
