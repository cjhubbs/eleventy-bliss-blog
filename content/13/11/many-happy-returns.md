Just a quick note here today to say Happy Birthday to my dear mother. (I'll call you later on today, Mom!)

Remembering her long annoyance on this day many years ago when us kids ran into church on a Wednesday night and breathlessly announced that it was Mom's birthday and she was turning 40!, I'll not mention her age here. (Maybe I can safely say is that while that event was on her 40th birthday, she and Dad have now surpassed their 40th anniversary.)

Mom invested the bulk of her life to raise and educate her five children, and remains an example of faithfulness, graciousness, and consistency to us all.

Happy birthday, Mom, and God's blessings on you for this next year and many more to come.
