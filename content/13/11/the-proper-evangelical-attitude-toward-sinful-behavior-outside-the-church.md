Here's one for ya this morning:

> The proper evangelical attitude toward sinful behavior outside the church should be one of wise resignation and acceptance. Thereâ€™s no gospel call to change the world into the church by law. In fact, it cannot be done.

Roger Olson, from _[How to be Evangelical Without Being Conservative](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00512QGNC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00512QGNC&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20)_.

I find this thought compelling. It seems so backwards to the evangelical ear, and definitely runs afoul of Dominion Theology, but I think Olson is right.
