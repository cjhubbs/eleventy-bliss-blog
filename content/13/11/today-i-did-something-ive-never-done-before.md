I bought two tickets to a big rock-and-roll show.

I've been an Arcade Fire fan for a few years now, but have never seen them in person. This morning their advance ticket sale went live for their 2014 tour, and after a quick consultation with Becky, I bought a pair.

Minneapolis. March 8. Happy early birthday to me!

And yeah, I bought General Admission Floor tickets. Because if you're gonna go to a big show, why do you want a chair in a fixed location if you can instead be down on the floor?

Also: many thanks to Becky for being agreeable. She's not a huge Arcade Fire fan, and not always one for big shows. Hopefully she'll enjoy this one.
