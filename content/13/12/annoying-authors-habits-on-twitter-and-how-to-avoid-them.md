We all follow one of 'em, don't we? An author who vigorously uses their Twitter account to publicize their work. (It's not limited to authors, but I'm gonna pick on them here. The same goes for lots of musicians as well.)

Now let me be fair for a minute. I follow a bunch of authors like this. Writing (or making music, etc.) is hard. Building an audience is hard. Publicizing what you do is a necessity. I get that.

But the following are a list of annoying author habits on Twitter that really, really need to be curtailed, and my oh-so-humble suggestions for how to avoid them. Here we go:

**1\. Retweeting every positive tweet about your post.**

It looks like this;

Now I get it: you're excited that somebody likes what you wrote, and want to acknowledge their love for what you did.

But the people following you are already fans of yours. You think they're gonna like you that much more just because somebody else tweeted your link? **Favorite that tweet instead.** It's a nice way to let the tweeter know that you, the author saw their tweet and appreciate their love and publicity. That's enough.

**2\. Tweeting multiple times to your post, each time with a different description.**

This hooks your readers in to thinking that you're linking something different, when in fact it's just back to something they probably already clicked on. It looks like this:

Again, I get it - you may have followers in different time zones, or who are on Twitter at different times of day, and you don't want them to miss your new post. But be honest about what you're doing. **Use "ICYMI" ("in case you missed it") instead.** Or just acknowledge it with something like "one more link to my totally awesome post in case you missed it last time". That way your followers know what you're linking, and you're a little bit less annoying.

**3\. Linking every time you add a comment to your own post.**

Like so:

I get it - having a good comment discussion on your post is exciting, and your readers will probably want to know about it so they can participate. But **provide some context**. Or just say "there's a good conversation going on in the comments for my totally awesome post." Then the people who are interested can get there, without a lot of annoying robo-posting.

**4\. Quoting praise without actually linking to it.**

This is probably the worst one. I follow at least one author who I really like, but who has the nasty habit of quoting the nice things you say about him w/o actually linking to where you said it.

This really defeats the purpose of even letting folks know that someone praised you. If they don't know the person who wrote the praise, why should they care what that person said? **Link directly to the praising post or tweet.** This provides context for what was said. And it helps build your online network. And it helps everybody's Google page rankings.

**In conclusion...**

I know that it's really tempting to want to repeat nice things that people have said about you. A well-known blogger tweeted a link to a post of mine last week, and in two hours I got more unique visitors to my blog than I usually get in four months. And that felt good. But did I need to publicize that fact? Nah. The affirmation was nice, but I don't need to brag. _(Wait, was that a humblebrag? Oops.)_

And finally, I feel kinda bad about writing a post that feels so much like, well, an annoying internet list post you'd find on Buzzfeed. I guess if I were really evil, I'd have split the post up so each list item was a separate page and I could build my pageview count. Guess I've avoided being evil. At least for today. There's always tomorrow.
