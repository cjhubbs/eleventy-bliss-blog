Last year I recorded some piano arrangements of familiar Christmas songs. I called it, originally enough, [_Carols for Christmas_](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/udiadekdc99akc6/AADzppw1KdFczRFiZaEZoU5Ea?dl=0).

As I explained it last year:

> It's just over 30 minutes worth of music, all piano versions of traditional Christmas carols. There's not a lot in the way of production - I recorded them using my Casio midi controller keyboard in single takes in GarageBand and did a minimal amount of editing to remove the clunky notes. The perfectionist part of me wishes I had another 80 hours to really refine and polish the arrangements and recordings; the engineer in me has declared "good enough". The engineer won the debate this time.

If you're so inclined, please enjoy _Carols for Christmas_ as my gift to you this season. This [download link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/udiadekdc99akc6/AADzppw1KdFczRFiZaEZoU5Ea?dl=0) will let you listen and/or download MP3s from Dropbox.
