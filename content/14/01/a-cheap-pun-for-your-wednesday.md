Growing up in the church as I did, and appreciating wordplay and humor, I'm of course familiar with most of the Bible-related puns that float around such circles. For instance:

> Q: Who was the shortest man in the Bible? A: Bildad the Shuhite (shoe-height!)

and

> Q: What's the only American state mentioned in the Bible?
>
> A: Arkansas. You know, in Genesis "Noah looked out of the ark and saw..."

and the ever classic

> Q: Did you know that Honda was mentioned in the Bible?
>
> A: Yeah, in Acts it says they were "all together in one Accord"!

Yesterday I was listening to a recent episode of Nomad Podcast, though, and they in passing had a one that I hadn't heard before and so as a service to my loyal readers I will pass along.

> Q: Who was the greatest financier in the Bible?
>
> A: Pharoah's daughter. She went to the Bank of the Nile and collected a profit (prophet)!

You may groan now.

(I have a sister-in-law who calls these "Hubbs jokes", and while I think the appreciation of cheap puns surely extends outside my family, I'm proud to carry on the tradition.)
