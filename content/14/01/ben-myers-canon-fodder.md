Australian theology professor Ben Myers ([@FaithTheology](http://twitter.com/faiththeology)) has been tweeting a fantastic series of 140-character commentaries on each book of the Bible, one tweet per book, delightfully tagged "Canon Fodder".

While it may initially seem dismissive to describe each book of the Bible as a one-liner, on the contrary Myers' tweets are insightful, pithy summaries that provoke thought and also draw some smiles.

Some examples:

> 1 Kings: So, you really want a monarchy huh? Don't say I didn't warn you. 2 Kings: I told you so.

> Psalms: The invention of antiphony: when my heart broke in two, I taught both parts to sing. Zephaniah: Cry out with horror, for I will sweep you from the earth. Cry out with joy, for I will sweep you into my arms. Acts: Proof of the resurrection: the powers of this world submit to a handkerchief on which an apostle has blown his nose.

And probably my favorite:

> Romans: Adam lost it, Christ found it, the Spirit gives it, faith holds it, creation yearns for it, death yields to it.
