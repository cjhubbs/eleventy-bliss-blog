Here's my one year-end post: a little summary of what I read this year. I'm not gonna list 'em all - you can go check out [the list on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101?shelf=2013-reads) if you're really interested - but I'll include some highlights.

I finished 57 books this year - about average for me over the past several years - and 27 of them were non-fiction, which is as close to fiction/non-fiction parity as I've ever gotten before. My non-fiction was mostly theology this year, which reminds me I need to pick up some more history, biographies, and the like in 2014.

**Top Non-Fiction**

I really need to write a full review post on _Playing God_. It was probably my favorite of the year, and the one that I then bought two copies of to give as Christmas gifts. I'm feeling a little bit better about my theological variety, too - it isn't just all Anglicans on my list this year!

It feels like a cheat to list Robinson's book here, since she uses the fictional narrative to drive home a bunch of theological and philosophical points, but hey, it's good stuff.

**The worst** I've gotten better at just putting books down if they seem like clunkers, so I have just a single one-star reviewed book on my list this year: _The Panther_ by Nelson DeMille. Here's what I wrote on Goodreads:

> Plot is thinner than thin. Hundreds of pages and nothing happens except we get a tour of Yemen and page after page of insufferable narrative. It's as if Mr DeMille had a quota of smart-ass internal dialog per page that he had to fill. If you cut out half of it, the book would shorten by 20% and still be just as boring.
>
> I'm ashamed I wasted as much time on this one as I did. Avoid.

**Plans for 2014** I'm likely to always be a theology, politics, and sci-fi geek, but I really would like to read some more history, some classic literature, and maybe even a little poetry. Hit me up if you have recommendations!
