Tonight I went to the theater and saw \*Her\*, the recent movie from Spike Jonze. For those who might not be familiar with the film, here's the trailer:

What an amazing film. So much to think about afterwards. How does our relationship with technology affect our relationships with people? Where do we find relational fulfillment? What is "real" in a relationship, anyway? Would a relationship that's exclusively about my happiness really make me happy in the long run?

Joaquin Phoenix gives a fantastic lead performance; Amy Adams is great as his friend, and Scarlett Johanssen plays a prominent role with her voice even though you never see her on screen. It's a beautiful film to look at, too - the use of colors, lights, and cityscapes is just lovely.

I came back to my hotel room tonight and turned on _Lost in Translation_, a 10-year-old movie also featuring Scarlett Johannsen and one that also leaves me with a raw inner yearning for relationship. The movies make a great pair.

My buddy Dan informed me tonight that the films are connected another way - Sofia Coppola, who wrote/directed _Lost in Translation_ was married for a few years to Jonze, who wrote/directed _Her_. Maybe they're both processing their breakup in similar ways?

I find myself thankful tonight for films that make me think, and even more, perhaps, for films that make me _feel_; not just the adrenaline rush of an action thriller or the sadness of a weepy drama, but the complicated ache of friendship, yearning, and love.
