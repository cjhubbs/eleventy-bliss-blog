Last night my wife and I went to see Jim Brickman in concert at the Paramount here in Cedar Rapids. This is the second time we've seen this age-defying (the guy is over 50 and looks about 30!) pianist perform, and I have just a few observations:

- To my ear, he played three wrong notes the entire evening, all of them before intermission. (Impressive, given the ridiculous number of notes he plays)
- Either his piano is waaaaay too bright or he plays everything too loud. His performance has very little sense of dynamics. Everything starts at a solid _forte_ and ends up somewhere around _fortissimo_.
- The guy never stops using the sustain pedal. He mentioned during the concert that he only took a few classical piano lessons, and that all he ever wanted to play was pop music. If he'd taken a few more classical lessons, a good teacher would've beat some better pedal technique into him. As it is, his sound is _uber_\-muddy.
- The dude has the most dramatic arm movements as he finishes a song of anybody I've ever seen play. Were I to try to do a parody, I think all I'd need is a few chord structures and those arm movements and I'd have it nailed. Might have to try it sometime.

OK, so I'm just a cranky pianist who shakes my head at the popular success of a guy like Brickman. It's gotta be kinda weird to be able to say (as he did last night,) "this is the song that you'll hear if you go to the kiosk at Target and push on my face".

But hey, it was a nice night out, my wife was happy, and we both agreed at the end of the evening that we've probably heard enough of Jim Brickman for a while. I'll call that a Valentine's Eve win.
