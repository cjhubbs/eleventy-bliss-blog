I caught the Casting Crowns song "Jesus, Friend of Sinners" on the radio the other day, and it's been an earworm ever since. It's a catchy tune, and I have good memories of playing percussion on it once while friends sang it at church.

The song has always felt like a little bit of a rebuke to me and to Christians in general - the message being "why aren't we loving sinners like Jesus did?".

> Jesus, friend of sinners, we have strayed so far away We cut down people in your name but the sword was never ours to swing Jesus, friend of sinners, the truth's become so hard to see The world is on their way to You but they're tripping over me Always looking around but never looking up I'm so double minded A plank eyed saint with dirty hands and a heart divided Oh Jesus, friend of sinners Open our eyes to the world at the end of our pointing fingers Let our hearts be led by mercy Help us reach with open hearts and open doors Oh Jesus, friend of sinners, break our hearts for what breaks yours

When I woke early this morning, though, I had a different, far more encouraging thought to start my day.

Jesus was a friend of sinners.

I am a sinner.

I can have confidence that Jesus embraces, loves, and befriends me.

Hallelujah.
