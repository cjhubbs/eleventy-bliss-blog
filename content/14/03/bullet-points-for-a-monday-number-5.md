Because, hey, it's been a long time since I've done one of these.

- Did my first three-service weekend on worship team the last two days. I think I made the right decision to go to only one week per month.
- The worship set, albeit short, was a good one.
- Did a special number with a friend and it turned out really well.
- Have come to happy acceptance of the fact that I'll never really be a soloist, but I can be a darn good backup singer. That works for me.
- Work has recently given me a case of 'be careful what you wish for because you might just get it'. More to follow, but it'll be an interesting next few months.
- We're right in the middle of birthday week at the Hubbs house. Two birthdays down, one to go. Being 37 doesn't make me feel nearly as old as having my youngest daughter turn 5 does.
- After [griping that I missed Markdown support](/14/03/ok-so-i-bailed-on-octopress/) in my move back to Wordpress, my friend [Randy](http://biblestudygeek.com/) pointed out that Wordpress added Markdown support via the Jetpack plugin a few months back. Huzzah!
- I've got a lot of thoughts brewing on the recent developments re: Bill Gothard and Mark Driscoll, but nothing really that feels solid enough or useful enough to be worth posting. Praying for all concerned.

Such are my scattered thoughts for Monday.
