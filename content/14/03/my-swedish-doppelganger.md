When my wife's sister and her husband recently visited Chile, they found this picture in a museum somewhere and sent it to my wife, noting that they'd found my doppelganger. I have to admit, I do see the resemblance. _(Click on it to see the big version.)_

The translation of the text with the photo (thanks, Google translate!):

> CARL SKOTTSBERG aboard the ANTARCTIC A student of philosophy and botany of the Nordenskjold expedition. Was 21 years and was one of the last to leave the ship when it sank in the Weddell Sea. After being rescued by the corvette Uruguay, Skottsberg continued his career as a botanist and performed numerous trips. He was the founder of the [Goteborg Botanical Garden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6teborg_Botanical_Garden) whose main street that borders bears his name.

It turns out that [Carl Skottsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Skottsberg) was indeed a Swedish botanist and explorer. It would appear that later in life his appearance and mine diverged a bit. (However, if anybody that's handy with Photoshop wants to mock-up what this guy would look like with a shaved head and goatee... be my guest!)

For a moment in our 20s, though, we might have been brothers.
