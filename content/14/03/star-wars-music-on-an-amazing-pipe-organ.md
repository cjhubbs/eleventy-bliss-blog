OK, this is pretty great. Organist [Jelani Eddington](http://www.rjeproductions.com/) performs a suite from the Star Wars soundtrack on a massive pipe organ. The [organ was built by Wurlitzer in 1927 for a theater in Omaha, NE](http://www.sanfilippofoundation.org/pipe-organ.html), and after restoration has been installed at [a museum in the suburbs of Chicago](http://www.sanfilippofoundation.org/index.html).

A little more about the organ:

> Mounted on the wall to the left are the 32' Diaphone pipes, and to the right are the 32' Bombarde pipes. A 32-note set of Deagan Tower Bells, the largest of which weighs 426 lb., hang on each side of the room. They are activated by huge solenoids from their own console, the organ console, a roll player, and even the doorbell button. To the rear of the room, the 'Ethereal' pipe chamber in the attic echoes softly from the skylight area, while the brass 'Trumpet Imperial' and copper 'Bugle Battaglia' speak with great authority from the back wall. ...  
> The grand piano connected to the pipe organ is a 9' Knabe concert grand with an Ampico 'A' reproducing player mechanism. To the right of the console is a rare Deagan Piano-Vibraharp, which can be played by its own keyboard or from the organ console. Toward the rear of the room is a Spanish art case Steinway model A.R. Duo-Art reproducing piano, veneered in walnut with boxwood, pear and ebony inlay. A remote Duo-Art Concertola roll changer has been adapted to play Ampico rolls on the Knabe, or Duo-Art rolls on the Steinway, at the touch of a button on its control panel.

Crazy. Anyhow, this video itself is impressive:
