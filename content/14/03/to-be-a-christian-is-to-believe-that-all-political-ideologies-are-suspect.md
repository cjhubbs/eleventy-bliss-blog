[Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry nails it:](http://theweek.com/article/index/257983/christian-conservatives-should-be-christians-first-and-conservatives-second)

> To be a Christian is to believe that all political ideologies are suspect. And wrong. It doesn't mean that Christians should retreat from all political ideologies â€” as that would also be a political ideology, and also wrong. By all means, be a Christian liberal. Be a Christian conservative. But if you are a Christian liberal, if you are a Christian conservative, then **by definition there will be tensions between your Christianity and your political ideology. It's axiomatic.** And if you are a Christian first and an ideologue second, you should confront those tensions instead of papering over them.

The whole post is worth a read.
