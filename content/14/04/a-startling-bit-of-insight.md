I've owned an iPhone for 18 months now, but haven't had a PIN in place to lock the device until yesterday. I'm gaining the ability to put work info on the phone, but to do so I have to have a PIN and an auto-lock on it. So, I set up a PIN and set it so that I'm required to re-enter the PIN after 15 minutes of inactivity.

What's been striking to me so far (after just one day with the PIN in place) is _how infrequently I have to enter the PIN_. Most of the time when I pull my phone out to look at something, I'm still within the 15 minute window since last time I had it out.

I haven't really evaluated yet whether this represents an unhealthy level of attachment / addiction, but it's been a startling (and somewhat troubling) bit of insight.
