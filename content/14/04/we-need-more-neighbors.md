There's been a lot of virtual ink spilled in the Christian blogosphere on the gay marriage topic the past couple of weeks after the World Vision U-turn. One of the benefits of not saying anything about it myself is that eventually someone comes along who says things a lot better than I would. Today that person is [Jen Hatmaker](http://jenhatmaker.com/blog/2014/04/02/where-i-stand). (All the emphasis in the quotes below is hers.)

First, she says,

> ...the reason I’ve always held this conviction \[about where she stands on homosexuality\] close, inviting only my real friends and family and community in, is because I am loathe to be a pawn in a hateful public war. I refuse to be a point in some win column, used for my influence and lumped into ancillary groupthink I don’t share. I’ve said before that this conversation best belongs in true relationships, around dinner tables, over coffee, in real life, and I still believe that.

And yet for the sake of those following her as a leader, she is willing to lay her cards on the table:

> I want you to know that I land on the side of traditional marriage as God’s first and clear design. I believe God’s original creation is how we were crafted to thrive: in marriage, in family, and in community, which has borne out for millennia in Scripture, interpretation, practice, and society (within and without the church).

But wait, she's not done, and her follow-up point is important.

> However, I remain disturbed and pierced at how many Christians have handled the gay community publicly. It is a source of extreme grief. We may share theology, but _the application of that truth_ remains a disconnecting point. While Scripture does command us to “speak the truth in love” (and surely Facebook is the dead worst place to exercise that practice), **that is not the end of our biblical responsibility.**

She then recounts Jesus' summing up all the law and the prophets as "love God and love your neighbor". Powerful stuff. And the man wanted to know "who is my neighbor"? What's my out? And Jesus tells the parable of the Good Samaritan.

Here's Jen's words again:

> As I lay in bed, it was instantly and perfectly clear that the gay community has been spiritually beaten, stripped of dignity, robbed of humanity, and left for dead by much of the church. **You need only look at the suicide rates, prevalence of self-harm, and the devastating pleas from ostracized gay people and those who love them to see what has plainly transpired.** Laying next to them, bloodied and bruised, are believers whose theology affirms homosexuality and allows them to stand alongside their gay friends. (Again, you don’t have to agree with this, but there are tens of thousands of thinking, studied people who hold this conviction.) **The spiritual gutting of these brothers and sisters is nothing short of shameful.** The mockery and dismissal and vitriol leveled at these folks is disgraceful. Also wounded on the side of the road are Christians who sincerely love God and people and believe homosexuality is a sin, but they’ve been lumped in with the Big Loud Mean Voices unfairly. **Painted as hateful intolerants, they are actually kind and loving and are simply trying to be faithful.** The paintbrush is too wide, the indictments unfounded.

And then she brings it home:

> We don’t get to abandon the theology of love toward people; the end does not justify the means. That is not Christ-like and it is certainly not biblical. **As a faith community, it is time we relearn what “speaking the truth in love” means. Something that actually feels like love is a start. If the beginning and end of love is simply pointing out sin, then we are doomed.** ... I am convinced we need no more soldiers in this war. We need more neighbors.

Thanks, Jen, for a powerful word.
