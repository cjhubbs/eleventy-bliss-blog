As a Cubs fan I set up my Yahoo sports iPhone app at the beginning of the season to pop up an alert with the final score at the end of each game.

My trouble is that the Cubs are, well, the Cubs. They're currently 11-20 and 9.5 games back in the NL Central. (And it's only May 7!) Which means I see a lot more alerts that look like this:

And not nearly enough that look like this:

Which gets kind of depressing, because if the Cubs' season continues as it's going right now, I'm going to see a "Cubs Win!" alert only about 55 times this year, and a "Cubs Lose" alert more than 100 times.

So here's an idea for some enterprising app designer: allow me to select the Cubs as my favorite team, and to get alerts for final scores, but add a flag **that only alerts me when the Cubs win**. That way every three or four days I get a nice surprise... and I don't have to deal with the disappointment the rest of the week.

I'd buy an app like that.
