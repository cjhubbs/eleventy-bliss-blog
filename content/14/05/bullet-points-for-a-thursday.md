Because hey, I haven't done one of these on a Thursday for a while.

- It's been kinda quiet at work this week. Certainly that won't last.
- Looks like I'm going to make my first trip to Europe in a couple of weeks for some work meetings. Gonna be a lot of flying for two days of work, but it'll at least cement my frequent flyer status for another year.
- With the cold wet weather all week I have this suspicion we're gonna go from pseudo-winter to summer without a decent stretch of spring in between. Which is kind of a bummer. I like spring.
- I'm not sure what it is about Stephen Hough's playing, but I've thoroughly enjoyed every record of his that I've gotten so far. (I got his new one, ["In the Night"](http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDA67996&vw=dc), this week. Hyperion has the digital downloads available a couple weeks before the CD drops.) My favorite is still [his recording of Rachmaninov's second concerto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VYF4Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002VYF4Y&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20&linkId=OURCUOEEZ6Q23NUT), though.
- I'm annoyed that Home Sharing doesn't work well on iOS7. I wanted to listen to that new Stephen Hough record on my phone in my bedroom last night, and should've been able to just hook up to home sharing from my iTunes library on my iMac. However, it stalls out about 80% of the way through the loading process and never actually works. Sounds like it's a known problem since iOS 5 or so.
- Even with that and a few other gripes with iOS, I have a hard time believing I could be inclined to get some Android phone instead of an iPhone 6 next time I need a phone.
- This fall will be the first time in nearly 15 years of owning a cell phone that I won't be champing at the bit for my 2-year contract to come up so I can get a new phone because I'm so unhappy with my old one. (I may be champing at the bit if the iPhone 6 is particularly awesome, though. I'd love a bigger screen, and to get a 32GB model instead of the 16GB iPhone 5 I have now.)

Well, that ended up more tech-oriented than I thought it would. Sorry. That's what you get for random bullet points.
