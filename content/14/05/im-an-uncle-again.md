The congratulations are due to my brother Andrew and his wife Heather on the birth of their second child, and first son, Isaiah David Hubbs. Isaiah was born this afternoon and everyone is doing well.

It's a bit odd, coming from a family with mostly boys, but Isaiah is my first nephew on either side of the family. Three nieces on my wife's side, three daughters, and Isaiah's big sister have equaled out to lots of estrogen. Glad to have this young man to start to restore balance!
