I know this has been all over the internet already, but I'm going to post it here anyway. It's a video of a group called Árstíðir singing the 13th-century Icelandic hymn _Heyr himna smiður_ in a German train station. The acoustics... amazing.

This reminds me of a college choir trip when we stopped at the Illinois Memorial at the Vicksburg National Military Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi. We sang a hymn in there that reverberated for what seemed like an eternity... such a cool experience.

Somehow, given the choice between lots of voices in big stone buildings made to reverberate and all the microphones and audio equipment we usually use on a Sunday... most of the time I think my preference is for the voices.
