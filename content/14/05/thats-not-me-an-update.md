Last month I wrote [That's not me!](/14/04/thats-not-me/), in which I lamented an Atlanta-based person using my Gmail address in contact forms and various online profiles, which had the end result of me getting frequent extra emails from car dealers, football teams, and cruise lines.

Yesterday, though, I got a little extra information. After getting another email from an Atlanta-area car dealership, I clicked on the unsubscribe link. The unsubscribe page it took me to included not just the contact email address, but also a contact cell number for texts and a contact mailing address.

So now, in theory, I could text or snail mail this person and let them know that their emails are coming to me. Now to decide if I _should_ do so, and how confusing it might be to try to explain the issue and how I got the person's cell number in the first place. Hmmmm.....
