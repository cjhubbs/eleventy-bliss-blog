Just a few random observations...

- Crazy softball game in our church league last night. We were behind 3-0 most of the night, then with two outs in the bottom of the 5th inning we scored 13 runs to invoke the mercy rule. Wild.
- I finally got my iPhone back from Apple after I sent it in to get the lock button replaced. Or at least I got _an_ iPhone back. I didn't record serial numbers, but the device ID reported by my work's network is different, and it's missing the little scratch on the screen. I'm not complaining - it's basically a like-new iPhone 5, 18 months after I originally purchased it.
- Curious what the iPhone 6 will turn out to be and whether it'll be enough to tempt me into an upgrade. If they have a larger device and I can get a decent price for my old iPhone, that might be enough... otherwise I can always wait for the inevitable iPhone 6S.
- I thought I lost my Fitbit somewhere going through security on the way home from my business trip last week. Was thinking it'd be a good excuse to need to check out the next round of wearable devices undoubtedly coming out this fall. Ends up I found it this morning in an obscure corner of my backpack. Oh well.
- Looking forward to meeting another "internet friend" in person tomorrow. I've met a couple dozen folks over the past decade who started out as "internet friends", and they've been pretty consistently awesome. I have no doubt this next one will be, too.
- I'm feeling really tired this morning. I have a few vacation days scheduled over the next couple weeks, which should help. I need to schedule a few more. Things just don't slow down.
