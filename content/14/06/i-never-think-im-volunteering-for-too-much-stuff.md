...and then it all piles up at once and gets _really_ busy.

_Help friends move?_

Absolutely, I'd love to.

_Substitute worship lead while the worship pastor's gone?_

Wouldn't miss it.

_Lead the Tuesday morning Bible study while the senior pastor's on sabbatical this summer?_

You bet! Let's keep the group going!

_Lead kids' music for our church backyard bible club for 4 nights?_

Well, sure.

And then from Saturday morning through Tuesday morning, all of them converge within 72 hours.

I'm not complaining, but I _am_ taking Monday and Tuesday as vacation days at work. I plan to collapse in a state of blessed exhaustion.
