In [a recent interview by Jonathan Merritt on Religion News Service](http://jonathanmerritt.religionnews.com/2014/06/03/nt-wright-homosexuality-science-gender/), Anglican bishop NT Wright had this to say about the Bible and how we work out ethics and doctrine (emphasis mine):

> ...**it’s important that we do not reduce the Bible to a collection of true doctrines and right ethics**. There are plenty of true doctrines and right ethics there, of course, but **they come within the larger thing, which is the story of how the Creator is rescuing and restoring the whole creation**, with his rescue and restoration of humans at the heart of it. In other words, it isn’t about “do we allow this or that?” To ask the question that way is already to admit defeat, to think in terms of behavior as a set of quasi-arbitrary, and hence negotiable, rules. We must ask, with Paul, “This new creation God has launched in Jesus—what does it look like, and how can we live well as genuine humans, as both a sign and a means of that renewal?” **We need to remind ourselves that the entire biblical sexual ethic is deeply counter-intuitive.** All human beings some of the time, and some human beings most of the time, have deep heartfelt longings for kinds of sexual intimacy or gratification (multiple partners, pornography, whatever) which do not reflect the creator’s best intentions for his human creatures, intentions through which new wisdom and flourishing will come to birth. **Sexual restraint is mandatory for all, difficult for most, extremely challenging for some. God is gracious and merciful but this never means “so his creational standards don’t really matter after all.”**

Such good perspective. I didn't realize until reading this interview that Wright has a new book out: [_Surprised by Scripture: Engaging Contemporary Issues_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062230530/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062230530&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20&linkId=D2HZMD2PGMJOWKFX). Another one to add to my reading pile!
