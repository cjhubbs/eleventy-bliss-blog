In the category of "Things that other people will write far better than I could if I just wait long enough": [Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry's review](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/inebriateme/2014/06/book-review-andy-crouch-playing-god/) of Andy Crouch's excellent book [_Playing God: Redeeming the Gift of Power_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F44LQ6Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00F44LQ6Y&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20&linkId=IG4PZ57REGESX5HC).

Every year I find some book that speaks strongly enough to me that I buy a few copies to give as Christmas gifts, usually to my Dad and a few pastor friends. Last Christmas they got a copy of this book from Andy Crouch. I highly recommend it, and Gobry does a far better job than I would at explaining why. Now I can delete that half-baked post that's been sitting in my drafts folder for months...
