Jared Wilson, in [a word to his brother pastors](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/gospeldrivenchurch/2014/06/04/what-they-need-on-sundays/):

> ...And come Sunday let’s spread the feast out rich and sumptuous, beckoning our people to taste and see that the Lord is good. They don’t need our doomsdaying or dimbulbing. Still less do they need our shallow pick-me-ups and spitpolished legalism. ... Our churches don’t need our hand-wringing but our hand-raising. They need our deep, abiding, all-conquering, sin-despairing gospel joy. This and this alone is the hope of the world.

That'll preach.
