...that's the promise I'm making myself. The book pile next to my bed is just too high, and I keep accumulating without making much progress. So, it's time to whittle down the pile.

In no particular order, here's what I've got piled up.

### First, the ones I've not read yet:

- _Surprised by Scripture_, NT Wright
- _Merton: A Biography_, Monica Furlong
- _Meditative Prayer_, Thomas Merton
- _Resurrection and Moral Order_, Oliver O'Donavan
- _Paul and the Faithfulness of God_, NT Wright
- _A Severe Mercy_, Shelden Vanauken
- _From the Bible Belt to the Sun Belt_, Darren Dochuk
- _Parables of Judgment_, Robert Capon
- _Theodore Rex_, Edmund Morris
- _Evangelical Theology_, Karl Barth
- _Confessions of a Guilty Bystander_, Thomas Merton
- _The Wounded Healer_, Henri J. M. Nouwen
- _The Monster in the Hollows_, Andrew Peterson

### Books I've started but not yet finished:

- _The Kingdom of Christ_, Russell Moore
- _Jesus Manifesto_, Frank Viola & Leonard Sweet
- _The Fiddler's Green_, A. S. Peterson

### Books I wanna re-read:

- _The Sacredness of Questioning Everything_, David Dark
- _When I Was a Child I Read Books_, Marilynne Robinson
- _Between Noon and Three_, Robert Capon

### Unread on my Kindle:

- _Barefoot Church: Serving the Least in a Consumer Culture_, Brandon Hatmaker
- _Center Church_, Tim Keller
- _The Pastor: A Memoir_, Eugene Peterson
- _Reimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream of Organic Christianity_, Frank Viola
- _Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation's Treasures from the Nazis_, Robert Edsel
- _Unclean: Meditations on Purity, Hospitality, and Mortality_, Richard Beck
- _Why Holiness Matters: We've Lost Our Way--But We Can Find it Again_, Tyler Braun

By my count, that's 26 books. At my current rate, I might finish them by the end of the year.

Unless I hit the Half Price Books or the library again and find another pile of reading material. But I'm gonna try not to.
