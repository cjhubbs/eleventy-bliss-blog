I finished up NT Wright's [_Surprised by Scripture_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FJ34XZQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FJ34XZQ&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20&linkId=DLPIGLRLRGIZPNHL) the other night. A nice short form of several of his arguments, some will be very familiar to those who have read his other popular works. There were a couple chapters, though, on politics and on women leading in the church that were new to me and quite good.
