Tonight we watched ["Dead Irish Writers"](http://www.westwingepguide.com/S3/Episodes/60_DIW.html), from the middle of season three. A couple of thoughts:

- I finally realized that the actor playing Lord John Marbury is the same guy (Roger Rees) who plays Robin Colcord on _Cheers_. That's hilarious.
- The long scene where Abbey, CJ, Donna, and guest star Mary-Louise Parker's Amy sit on the couch and drink wine and talk is simply brilliant - a stand out scene in a series of fantastic scenes.

Such a great show.
