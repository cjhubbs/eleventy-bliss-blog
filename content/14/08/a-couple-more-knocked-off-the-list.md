I had a business trip last week which gave me extra reading time, so... two more knocked off the list.

First, [_Merton: A Biography_ by Monica Furlong](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060630795/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060630795&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20&linkId=IWAAM3OEMD7BNPSA). This one underwhelmed me. The first part of the story (up to the point where Merton joins the Trappists) is told in a much more interesting fashion by Merton himself in _The Seven Storey Mountain_ (which I read a couple years back). The second half of the story mostly exists to make you repeatedly ask why anyone in their right mind would join the Trappists.

Second (and much more highly recommended): [_The Pastor: A Memoir_ by Eugene Peterson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061988219/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061988219&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20&linkId=JLTET2F6N52KE6W3). Peterson is a hero among pastors to me - a man planted a church and stayed there for 30 years, who focused not on numeric growth but on spiritual growth, who made it his goal to simply consistently _pastor_ (an active verb) the flock that God brought him... Peterson recounts his childhood, his call to ministry, and the lessons learned from decades of pastoring in his usual winsome way. Well worth the read.
