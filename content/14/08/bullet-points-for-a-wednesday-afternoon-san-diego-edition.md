I'm on business travel this week to San Diego and with so many thoughts rattling around in my head, bullet points might be as good as it gets for now.

- There's been a long-time West Coast - East Coast argument among my friends related to burger joints: In-N-Out vs. Five Guys. I like Five Guys, and today made my first trip to In-N-Out. It was fine, but it's no Five Guys.
- I had more response on Twitter and Facebook to my burger joint comments than I've had on any post for months. Apparently I have a lot of friends who have very strong opinions about burger joints.
- It's been a burger-heavy trip; I ate at [Hodad's](http://hodadies.com/) at a friend's recommendation on Monday night. It was also pretty tasty.
- I love the SoCal weather but can't imagine living here. _The traffic_. :shudder:

Some thoughts unrelated to my location this week, in decreasing levels of significance:

- Ferguson, Missouri. So sad. So much pent-up history rearing its head the past week or two.
- Everywhere else in the world: apparently also falling apart. Come quickly Lord Jesus.
- I have a long post about death rattling around in my head but no time or will to write it right now.
- I've found precious little interesting new music this year, but the eponymous debut record by the band Colony House is a winner.
- I won (well, shared) the "Special K" award in our church softball league this season: the award for the most strikeouts. I think I had two.
