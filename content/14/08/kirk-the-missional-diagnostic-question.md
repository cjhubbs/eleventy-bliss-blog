"Missional" is a word that has been used so much in the evangelical church-planting movement over the past decade that it's almost losing meaning. (See also: "Gospel-centered".) But Fuller seminary professor J. R. Daniel Kirk [proposes a 'missional diagnostic question' today](http://www.jrdkirk.com/2014/08/04/missional-diagnostic-question/) that makes a lot of sense to me.

> The question is this: _“If this church disappeared, would our community miss it?”_ That’s it. If we are on mission in such a way that we are loving our neighbors and seeking their good rather than our own, it will be a cause of grief for our community if our church shuts its doors. If we’re living to build the place, pack in as many as we can, then they won’t care.

This rings true to me, and it's a question I'd love to see our churches and ministries that talk about being "missional" ask of themselves. It might just be a useful evaluation.
