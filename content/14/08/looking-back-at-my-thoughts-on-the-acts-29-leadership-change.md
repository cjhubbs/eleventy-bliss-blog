[My post from March 2012 about Matt Chandler taking over the reins of Acts 29](http://chrishubbs.com/2012/03/28/some-thoughts-on-matt-chandlers-move-to-lead-acts-29/) has seen some renewed activity this past week with the news that Acts 29 booted Mark Driscoll and Mars Hill Church from membership in the church planting network.

Last week's move is a significant one, seeing (as [Wenatchee the Hatchet has documented](http://wenatcheethehatchet.blogspot.com/2014/08/in-consideration-of-recent-events-blast.html)) that for most of its existence, Acts 29 was, both by leadership and funding, nearly indistinguishable from Mars Hill.

In 2012 I had four key thoughts:

### Chandler was a strong enough personality to bring about change.

This seems to have borne itself out; it can't have been easy for Chandler and company to call on Driscoll to resign, but under Chandler's leadership Acts 29 has done exactly that.

### Chandler could help change A29 culture

Not sure that this has really happened, but I'm hopeful that it will start to as days go by. For too long the A29 church planter model appears to have encouraged not just the Mars Hill church style but the Mark Driscoll leadership style - brash, vulgar, MMA-loving, trash-talking, in-your-face "leadership". One good that could come out of Driscoll's current woes is for some of his acolytes to recognize the folly of emulating that persona.

### Acts 29 could start to get some distance from Driscoll's controversies

Well, _that one_ clearly hasn't happened yet.

### Driscoll could have some room to rest and grow

I was hopeful that with A29 leadership off his plate, Driscoll might have time to relax, refresh, and recharge. Perhaps I was a little bit optimistic.

Regardless of where you stand on Acts 29 and Mark Driscoll, this is no time for gloating. I continue to pray that Driscoll will come to real repentance and seek reconciliation with those he has harmed, and that the Acts 29 network will be strengthened, not damaged, from Driscoll's ouster.
