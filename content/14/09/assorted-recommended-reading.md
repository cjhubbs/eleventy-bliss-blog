I haven't had a lot of original thoughts to share in long-form here on the blog lately, but I can pass along some links that are good recommended reading:

- [**Scandal and Madam Secretary: A Tale of Two Political Dramas**](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/september-web-only/tale-of-two-political-dramas.html) - In days when it's hard to not be cynical about anything remotely political, I really appreciated Alissa Wilkinson's attitude toward the new show _Madam Secretary_. It reminded me what it means to "hope all things".
- [**Disorderly (mis)Conduct: The Problem with 'Contempt of Cop' Arrests**](https://www.acslaw.org/sites/default/files/Lopez_Contempt_of_Cop.pdf) (PDF) by Christy E. Lopez. Ms. Lopez apparently now works for the DOJ and is part of the federal Ferguson investigation. A good piece documenting issues with the 'contempt of cop' arrests and making recommendations for making improvements.
- [**Justice then Reconciliation**](http://austinchanning.com/blog/2014/9/justice-then-reconciliation) - Austin Channing Brown bringing the truth. "Reconciliation is what we practice after we have chosen justice." Powerful.
- [**College Girls: Education, Imago Dei, and the Gospel**](http://www.sometimesalight.com/1/post/2014/09/college-girls-education-imago-dei-gospel.html) - Hannah Anderson bringing truth on why we educate both boys and girls: "We educate girls and women for the same reason we educate boys and men. We educate our daughters because they are made in Godâ€™s image. Full. Stop." Bravo.
- [**How does the iOS 8 Time-lapse feature work?**](http://www.studioneat.com/blogs/main/15467765-how-does-the-ios-8-time-lapse-feature-work) - Just so I'm not linking to all political and theological heaviness, here's some nerdiness to go along with it. Apple came up with a fiendishly clever and simple way to do the time-lapse video thing. Really neat.

So yeah, there's some recommended reading. Enough for now, I'm going to bed.
