So, what have I been up to reading-wise? I don't know that any of you were actually asking yourselves that, but I'm going to answer anyway.

- I really enjoyed Richard Beck's _Unclean_.
- I read the first chapter of Vanauken's _A Severe Mercy_ and found it slow-going stylistically. I've heard so many folks say so much good about it I'll keep at it and see if it gets better, though.
- I started O'Donavan's _Resurrection and Moral Order_ and wow, it's dense. That's not necessarily bad, but wow. Of course, maybe I should've taken the hint when Alistair Roberts told me that you had best read it slowly.
- I read a quick WEB Griffin novel and a short popular history.

Business trip again next week so maybe I'll get some more substantive reading done.

_As an aside: I mentioned a discussion this week with a couple of co-workers that I've logged and rated every book I've read over the past 8 years. They looked at me like I was nuts. I trust you, dear reader, won't judge me near so harshly._
