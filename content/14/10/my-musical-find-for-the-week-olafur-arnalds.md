I started an Arvo Pärt station on Pandora earlier this week and one of the artists that kept coming up was someone by the name of [Ólafur Arnalds](http://olafurarnalds.com/). Having never heard of Arnalds, I set off to learn more, and to listen. And I liked what I found.

Arnalds is a young (still in his 20s!) Icelandic composer/musician whose sweet spot musically is sort of minimalist ambient instrumentals. Think Sigur Rós without all of Jónsi's vocals and turned down a couple notches on the intensity meter. Or think happier Phillip Glass, or what you'd get if you crossed Brian Eno's ambient stuff with Jim Brickman's piano and harmonies. However you get there, his music pretty well hits a sweet spot for me, especially as these grey fall days start to fade to winter.

_Side note: if you're pedantic like me, writing about ambient European musicians will also make you learn to find all the accented letter character key codes. You have been warned._
