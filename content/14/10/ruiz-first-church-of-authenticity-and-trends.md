[Miguel Ruiz, over at Internet Monk, has this gem:](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/miguel-ruiz-first-church-of-authenticity-and-trends)

> If you can indulge me a moment of satire, what if the impression we sought to give our communities for the reason our church exists looked more like this:  
> <br/>
> “Grumpy people, bored or frustrated with life, mundane diet of dirges, dull worship, droning sermons, focused on just surviving, burnt coffee, constricting atmosphere, hiding behind a mask of formalism, and little activity outside of Sunday morning. What kind of a God would want us? Join us on Sunday to hear all about the wonderful love of a crucified Savior. We might bore you to death, but you’ll be in good company!”

The whole piece is worth a read.
