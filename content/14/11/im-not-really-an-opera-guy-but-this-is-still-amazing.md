[Diana Damrau sings the Queen of the Night aria from The Magic Flute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpVV9jShEzU).

Amazing control, making the ridiculously high notes[1](#fn-12643-1) seem really easy, and putting such personality into the role... brilliant stuff.

2. Per [the Wikipedia article on this aria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_H%C3%B6lle_Rache_kocht_in_meinem_Herzen), the high note is F6, i.e. two and a half octaves above middle C. Crazy. [↩](#fnref-12643-1)
