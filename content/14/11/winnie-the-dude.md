On the topic of [my previous post](http://chrishubbs.com/2014/11/06/o-bother-where-art-thou/), I had this Twitter interaction with Stephen Granade:

But then I started wondering... what about _Lebowski_?

So then I had to do it - casting _The Big Lebowski_ using Winnie the Pooh characters.

### The Dude

This one is pretty obvious. Winnie the Pooh himself gets to play The Dude. His laid-back personality is nicely analogous to Jeff Bridges' beloved stoner.

### Walter Sobchak

Based on my Twitter assertion, I'm gonna commit to it. Tigger is the only Hundred-Acre Wood inhabitant with a personality big enough to play a John Goodman character. Think of it as the grittier side of Tigger. You know he's not always been such a jovial tiger.

### Donny

Who's gonna be the weasely, nervous sidekick to Tigger's Walter? I think it's gotta be Piglet.

### The Big Lebowski

A large, pompous man with a big attitude? Owl gets to play this role, no question about it. And then to serve his needs:

### Brandt

This nervous young assistant (played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman in _Lebowski_) goes to Rabbit. You can just see him puttering around straightening all of Lebowski's photos and trophies outside his office.

### Minor Characters

- With Kanga being the token female in the Hundred-Acre Wood, we'll give her the role of Maude Lebowski.
- Christopher Robin would have to paste on a mustache and work on his Texas accent, but we'll give him the role of The Stranger.
- And where's Eeyore in this whole thing? Based on his general outlook on life, I think he's one of the Nihilists. However, as my friend [Andy](https://twitter.com/The_Pulpiteer) said:
