I've felt a need for Advent far more keenly this year than I recall from previous years. Perhaps it's the tumult of the times - with religious violence abroad and racial tension at home, it is so clear that we need the peace, deliverance, and salvation that Jesus brings now more than ever.

That brings me to Andrew Peterson's [_Behold the Lamb of God_](https://store.rabbitroom.com/product/behold-the-lamb-of-god-2-cd-set). It's long been my favorite Christmas record; in my estimation it's one of only two or three perfect Christian records to have been made. Early in the record as Andrew tells the story of Christ, the song "Deliver Us" introduces the longing cry of God's people for God's salvation. And the lyrics seem as appropriate today as ever:

> Our enemy, our captor is no pharaoh on the Nile
> Our toil is neither mud nor brick nor sand
> Our ankles bear no calluses from chains, yet Lord, we're bound
> Imprisoned here, we dwell in our own land  
> <br/>
> _Deliver us, deliver us Oh Yahweh, hear our cry_ > _And gather us beneath your wings tonight_  
> <br/>
> Our sins they are more numerous than all the lambs we slay  
> These shackles they were made with our own hands
> Our toil is our atonement and our freedom yours to give
> So Yahweh, break your silence if you can  
> <br/>
> _Deliver us, deliver us Oh Yahweh, hear our cry_ > _And gather us beneath your wings tonight_  
> <br/>
> \[Response:\] 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem How often I have longed To gather you beneath my gentle wings'

Come, Lord Jesus.
