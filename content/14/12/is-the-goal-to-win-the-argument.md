These two tweets showed up on my timeline within 10 minutes of each other this morning. And they highlight a fundamental concern I have with the intellectual defense arguments for the Gospel.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not advocating a check-your-brain-at-the-door version of Christianity. But I think Zahnd is right - arguments by themselves don't win people.

I mean, hey, the next time a Jehovah's Witness approaches you at a restaurant or bar you can grab the nearest napkin and [sketch out a little grid](http://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2014/12/17/how-to-use-the-back-of-a-napkin-to-prove-to-a-jehovahs-witness-that-jesus-is-god/) that will logically completely prove that you're right and they're wrong. But if you think that once you've done that the JW is going to tear up their Watchtower and come to your evangelical church next Sunday, you've got another think coming.

When I look over my own spiritual progression of the past two decades, I've never had an intellectual _Eureka!_ moment change my beliefs. (I might almost say that reading NTW's _Surprised by Hope_ was that sort of experience, but that was more putting words and reason to what I knew must be true but hadn't heard expressed before.) What _has_ changed me is a long, persistent interaction with other believers over time.

Changes haven't come by having my arm twisted; they've come by others gently taking my hand and saying "hey, I'm headed this way, what do you think?". Sure, occasionally an earthquake radically moves things in a moment; far more often wind and rain slowly shape new paths where before there were none.

There are a lot of things I'm _not_ saying here, so don't hear them. I'm not saying that we should never present logical arguments for the Gospel, or that we shouldn't share it with JWs or anyone else that comes along. I'm glad that there are people who have written great intellectual defenses of the Christian faith. I'm not saying that God can't or won't use a direct presentation of the Gospel as the tool to bring someone to faith.

But the attitude of "here's the diagram you need to know to prove the JWs wrong" greatly neglects the realities of _how_ people change, and instead encourages an attitude of intellectual superiority. Please don't go out there with the attitude that any unbeliever will suddenly see the light if only you can draw the right back-of-the-napkin diagram.

We of all people should recognize that it is only God's action to open our eyes that brings us to faith, and **that** should provoke in us not an intellectual arrogance but rather a great humility.
