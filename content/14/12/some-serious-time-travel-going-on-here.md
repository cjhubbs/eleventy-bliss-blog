I'll confess - I did almost all my Christmas shopping via Amazon this year. Amazon is usually bang on with shipping, but they clearly get bogged down in the Christmas rush. Exhibit 1: the tracking on this package of mine from yesterday.

Delivered just before noon.

Left Amazon facility: 7.5 hours **later**.

But hey, if my choices are have the package get to me on time or have the website shipping info be accurate, I'll happily accept the fact that the box was sitting on my doorstep when I got home yesterday.
