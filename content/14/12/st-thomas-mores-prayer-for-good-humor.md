I ran across this fantastic prayer this morning in [a story about Pope Francis](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2014/12/pope-francis-reveals-a-saint-he-prays-to-every-day/). (Reportedly the Pope prays this prayer daily.) It's beautiful, funny, and practical all in one.

> #### Prayer for Good Humor
> 
> Grant me, O Lord, good digestion, and also something to digest. Grant me a healthy body, and the necessary good humor to maintain it. Grant me a simple soul that knows to treasure all that is good and that doesn’t frighten easily at the sight of evil, but rather finds the means to put things back in their place. Give me a soul that knows not boredom, grumblings, sighs and laments, nor excess of stress, because of that obstructing thing called “I.” Grant me, O Lord, a sense of good humor. Allow me the grace to be able to take a joke to discover in life a bit of joy, and to be able to share it with others. -St. Thomas More, Chancellor to King Henry VIII
