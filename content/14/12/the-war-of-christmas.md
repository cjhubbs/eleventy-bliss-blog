[@pegobry with a great post about the subversive and challenging nature of Christ's advent:](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/inebriateme/2014/12/its-not-the-war-on-christmas-its-the-war-of-christmas/)

> Is there a war on Christmas? No, there’s no war on Christmas. There’s a war _of_ Christmas. Because that’s what Christmas is: a declaration of war. Against all the thrones, dominions, principalities and powers who hold creation in bondage. Saying there’s a war on Christmas is like saying the Germans fought a war on D-Day–of _course_ there’s a war on Christmas. How do we fight this war? Not by yelling at Walmart greeters who say “Happy Holidays.” Not with consumerism. Like Jesus fought his. With increased penance and asceticism and prayer and reception of the sacraments. With corporeal works of mercy. With peace, mercy, some truth-telling, and a very large heaping of loving-kindness. This is our D-Day: this is the most stupendous claim of Christianity.

PEG sounds like he's been reading his NT Wright. Really good stuff.
