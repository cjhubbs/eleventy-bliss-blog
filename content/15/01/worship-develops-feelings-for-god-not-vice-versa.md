This wonderful little bit of insight came across my Twitter feed this morning and I've been chewing on it all day. It strikes me that this is one key reason why the lyrical content of worship songs sung in church is so important to me.

The insipid worship music designed to inspire a _feeling_ nearly always rubs me the wrong way. I'm painfully aware of when my emotions are being manipulated, and I recoil.

On the other hand, when I sing good content, powerful truths, they move me. They sink in and _then_ engage my emotions in worship. But it's the willingness to come to worship and the truth sinking in to my heart that brings the emotion, and not the reverse.

Thanks, Pastor Eugene.
