I would never have run across this album were it not for [Jeffrey Overstreet tweeting about it](https://twitter.com/Overstweet/status/554156576886358016) yesterday. (Thanks, Jeff!)

[Laghdú](http://store.irishmusic.net/album/laghd) is a new album of Irish fiddle music played by Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh and Dan Trueman. These guys are playing unique, custom [10-string fiddles](http://www.fiolinmaker.no/en/instrumenter/5pluss5.php) and creating a fascinating, minimalist style.

The music is wonderful and difficult to describe all at the same time; think Arvo Pärt meets traditional Irish fiddle playing, or, as @ChadComello responded to Overstreet, it's as if Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead guitarist and composer of film scores to _There Will Be Blood_ and _The Master_) had scored Braveheart.

Here's a sample:

You can download the MP3 (or other audio format of your choice) for "name your price" (including free, though it's worth a donation) [at their website](http://store.irishmusic.net/album/laghd).
