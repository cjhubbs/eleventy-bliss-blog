We're finishing up Birthday Week at the Hubbs house by celebrating today as the youngest turns 6. KP is a pistol - always moving fast to keep up with her sisters, often singing quietly to herself while she plays, she loves to laugh and dance and wear shirts that have flouncy tutu waists.

Given the photos available to me on my phone for sharing here, she also appears to like eating ice cream and taking selfies with dad.

She's the only one of our kids born in the Twitter era, which makes it amusing to browse back and see what in the world I was posting to Twitter when she was born. I didn't post a lot - hey, no smartphone back then - but at least one post proves that while kids may grow up, some things never change:

Happy birthday, little lady!
