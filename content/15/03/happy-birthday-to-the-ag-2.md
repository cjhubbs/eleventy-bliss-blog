Our middle daughter, Addison, enters her last single-digit year today. Hard to believe that nine years have flown by so quickly!

This young lady is a free spirit, a voracious reader, and a math whiz. Life is never dull with her around. She has a sense of style and funky attitude that set her apart from the crowd.

I love this young lady dearly and couldn't be prouder to be her dad.
