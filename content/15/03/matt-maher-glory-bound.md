I'm not a big listener of CCM and Praise & Worship music, but Matt Maher's stuff has been growing on me lately. He has a new record out this week called [Saints and Sinners](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U0VCJRQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00U0VCJRQ&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20&linkId=3VZC5K4S5W3T7GWW), and I've been enjoying it quite a bit.

Here he goes full Springsteen on "Glory Bound", which is a heckuva lot of fun:
