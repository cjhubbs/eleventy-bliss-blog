I gotta say, this XKCD from last week cracked me up, if only mostly for the alt text (which I've posted below the image here).

"Mr. President, what if the unthinkable happens? What if the launch goes wrong, and Napoleon is not stranded on the Moon?" "Have Safire write up a speech."

I've been a fan of the late great William Safire ever since finding his On Language columns (collected into several volumes) as a kid. The reference here is to [the speech that Nixon had Safire draft to be used in the event that the Apollo 11 moon landing went wrong](http://gawker.com/5369364/william-safires-finest-speech). It's a beautiful bit of what-if history.
