[Marco Arment recently posted about how few popular movies he's seen](http://www.marco.org/2015/04/11/popular-movies-i-havent-seen), and proves it by listing out seen/not-seen:

> In an effort to accelerate that, here’s a list of the Academy Award Best Picture nominees and top 10 highest-grossing films for the last 15 years. My “I’ve seen it” ratio starts bad and only gets worse over time. Had I not seen most of the Pixar movies because I have a kid, it would be even worse.

Because I'm a sucker for lists I figured I'd do my own evaluation. When I get done I can decide whether I feel bad for missing a lot of them or feel bad for how much time I spent on them.

Key: Seen it, Haven’t seen it
