Richard Beck had [a great little piece the other day about being relaxed](http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2015/04/consider.html). It challenged me.

> In yesterday's post I included the word "relaxed" in a list of traits that I felt characterize what it means to be a Christ-like human being. But relaxed isn't a word you hear a great deal in discussions of Christian virtue and character. And yet, I think relaxation is key, a foundational issue.

I think he might be on to something here. So how do we relax, you ask?

> Jesus's answer is twofold. First, trust. Trust that God will take care for you. Consider the lilies and the birds. Second, place your heart in a location where moth and rust do not destroy or thieves break in and steal. Your heart must be "hidden in Christ" in a place where death has no dominion. Trouble is, these recommendations strike us as pious platitudes.
