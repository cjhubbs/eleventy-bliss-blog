A self-professed "child of the 1990s’ Christian subculture" [recounts her experience](http://theothersideofreason.com/2015/04/09/2914/) revisiting that culture after many years away from it:

> When I pulled into the parking lot for the concert, I immediately had a sense of foreboding. I had mostly come to see a favorite singer-songwriter, well-known in Nashville but still touring with larger acts in other parts of the country. For this concert, she was touring with an old high school favorite, and I didn’t think much of it, except that it might be fun to hear them play again. I hadn’t looked into it any further than that, and had been to plenty of church-based concerts in the years since leaving the evangelical church (for lack of better term), so I had no reason to think this one would be any different. Except that it was.

Susan does an excellent job of not questioning the motives or intentions of the concert audience while still asking some pointed questions about the motivations of the performers and producers, and about how the "worship experience" is managed and (potentially) manipulated.

It's worth reading [the entire thoughtful post](http://theothersideofreason.com/2015/04/09/2914/).
