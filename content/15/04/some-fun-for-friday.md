I had about five things turn up in my RSS reading today that I want to blog before long. But it's Friday, which merits things entertaining and lighthearted.

First up: a jazzy cover of Radiohead's classic song "Creep", with American Idol singer Haley Reinhart on vocals. (They replace the F word in this version with something cleaner, so it's safe to turn on in front of small children.) I love how great songs manage to be viable and stay great even when transformed into a different genre. This is a good example.

Next up: Sesame Street reminds us again that it writes most of its humor to amuse the parents who would otherwise grow unbearably weary of its puppets. The latest example: "Game of Chairs". Fans of Game of Thrones should be quite amused.
