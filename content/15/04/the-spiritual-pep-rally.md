Really good stuff on the Christian movie phenomenon, in the deliciously-titled [“Do You Believe in Confirmation Bias?”](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/march-web-only/do-you-believe-in-confirmation-bias.html)

> I do remain concerned, however, that when such anecdotal evidence \[e.g. of Atheist professors persecuting Christian students\] is amplified and looped in and through the echo chamber, it has a detrimental effect on God’s people. It promotes a culture of fear and a culture of antagonism. It reinforces the belief that those outside our circle are our enemies, to be battled, rather than our mission field, to be loved and evangelized.  
> <br/>
> To the extent it overstates our persecution, it pushes us to prioritize standing our ground and protecting our rights over being salt and light. To the extent it fixates on archetypal stories of our victimization, it makes us quick to assume evil intent when we face conflicts and slow to acknowledge our own roles in perpetuating them.  
> <br/>
> Perhaps—perhaps—it tempts us with the lie that those times and places where we have been wronged justify ignoring our teachers’ admonitions to treat those who question our beliefs with gentleness and respect.  
> <br/>
> Maybe the more pertinent question to ask in the face of Christian movies like God’s Not Dead and Do You Believe? is not whether they are accurate representations of the world we live in, but whether the way they respond—and invite us to respond—to that broken world will help us to remake it into something healthier, holier, and more reflective of kingdom principles.
