I've had the sacraments (especially the Eucharist) on my mind lately after reading James K. A. Smith's _Desiring the Kingdom_, and then listening to the [On Being podcast](http://onbeing.org/program/father-greg-boyle-on-the-calling-of-delight/5053) this morning I found this bit from Father Greg Boyle, a delightful Jesuit priest who has spent his life working with gang members in Los Angeles:

> Jesus doesn't lose any sleep that we will forget that the Eucharist is sacred; He is anxious that we might forget that it's ordinary, that it's a meal shared among friends, because if we don't see that, then we'll be unable to recognize the sacred in the ordinary, and **that's** the incarnation.

Interesting to hear from a Catholic. But in my experience, this is a trap we Evangelicals have fallen into at various times, too.
