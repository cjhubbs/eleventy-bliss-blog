I'm working my way through Jamie Smith's _Desiring the Kingdom_, and he is driving home the point that it's not just our minds that need formed, but our hearts. He argues that humans are not, at a base level, _thinkers_, but _lovers_. As such, Christians need to be concerned not just with education, but with formation of our practices and desires. I'm sure I'll have more thoughts later, but this quote stuck out today:

> Unfortunately, the church often adopts a ... misguided strategy: while the mall, Victoria's Secret, and Jerry Bruckheimer are grabbing hold of our gut (_kardia_) by means of our body and its senses - in stories and images, sights and sound, and commercial versions of "smells and bells" - the church's response is oddly rationalist. 
> 
> It plunks us down in a "worship" service, the culmination of which is a forty-five-minute didactic sermon, a sort of holy lecture, trying to _convince_ us of the dangers by implanting doctrines and beliefs in our minds. 
> 
> While the mall paradoxically appreciates that we are liturgical, desiring animals, the (Protestant) church still tends to see us as Cartesian minds. While secular liturgies are after our hearts through our bodies, the church thinks it only has to get into our heads. While Victoria's Secret is fanning a flame in our _kardia_, the church is trucking water to our minds. While secular liturgies are enticing us with affective images of a good life, the church is trying to convince us otherwise by depositing ideas.

Hmmmmm...
