So my head started nodding enthusiastically yesterday when listening to the [Reconcilable Differences](http://www.relay.fm/rd/2) podcast, when I heard Merlin Mann say this about the possibility that he's a contrarian (at about 22 minutes into the episode):

> What a lot of people get and that some people don't get is that you're not trying to be difficult, but that the more you enjoy something the more you're interested in seeing how it could be better. And here's a thing that's actually not such a big deal that you could make better. It's not an insult, it's not a slam. And for me, whenever people say "oh you gotta to out and set goals for yourself", I'll be "well, maybe". You know goals can really be self-defeating if they aren't updated and realistic. "Oh you should never have goals." Well, that's not true. Do you really wanna play tennis without a net? I feel like maybe I'm more of a contrarian? I feel like, whenever somebody comes up with something that's, like, an unvulnerable pronouncement about how the world mostly always is, it gets my dander up a little bit, and I don't feel like I _have_ to say something, but I know I'm thinking that person's probably a little bit of a bozo.

Preach, brother Merlin. Preach.
