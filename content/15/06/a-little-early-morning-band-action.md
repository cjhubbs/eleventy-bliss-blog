I play with a band called [Standing Before Giants](http://standingbeforegiants.com/) off and on. (I don't show up on the official band info, but they pull me in for gigs on a semi-regular basis. It works.) On Sunday we're playing at Praise on the River - a fundraiser for the local free medical clinic.

To publicize things this morning we played a 30-minute acoustic set on the stage at the local Farmer's Market. Nothing like having to be tuned up and ready to sing at 7:30 am!

If you're around Cedar Rapids tomorrow (Sunday June 21), come down to the amphitheater and listen to the music! Full band mode will be engaged for that one (i.e. I'll have my keyboard with me!).
