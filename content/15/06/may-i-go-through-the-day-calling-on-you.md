A beautiful prayer, credited only as an "Ethiopian Prayer", from today's noon-time reading in Phyllis Tickle's [_The Divine Hours_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385505574/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385505574&linkCode=as2&tag=chrishubbs-20&linkId=33WHEXFA76GRJKFC):

> God, you have prepared in peace the path I must follow today. Help me to walk straight on that path. If I speak, remove lies from my lips. If I am hungry, take away from me all complaint. If I have plenty, destroy pride in me. May I go through the day calling on you, you, O Lord, who know no other Lord.

Amen.
