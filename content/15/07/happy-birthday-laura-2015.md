How am I old enough to have an 11-year-old? It doesn't seem I've gotten that much older... and yet this young lady grows in stature, beauty, and general awesomeness every year. Whether she's playing with the cat, hanging with her sisters, helping her Mom, or having some other sort of fun, she's a delight.

Happy birthday, Laura! You're a blessing to our family, and it's a wonderful treat to be your Dad.
