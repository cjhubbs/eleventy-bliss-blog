So yeah, it's one of those months. I need a clone. Or two. Or five.

Think of it this way:

## "Chris gets work done, Orphan Black-style"

### Family

Orphan Black has Sarah - mother, sister, daughter, driven by love for family.

I have Dad Chris.

### The Pretty Face

Orphan Black has Allison - perky suburban housewife who runs her own business and is dabbling in politics.

I have soon-to-be-a-manager-at-work Chris.

### The Technical Expert

Orphan Black has Cosima - cute hippy scientist who gets crap figured out.

I have engineer-who-makes-sure-our-products-don't-crash-airplanes Chris.

### The Meanie

Orphan Black has Rachel - brutal corporate executive.

I have doesn't-put-up-with-any-crap-from-program-managers Chris.

### The Scary One

Orphan Black has Helena.

I have after-a-long-day-of-juggling-all-this Chris.

I think it would work out rather nicely.
