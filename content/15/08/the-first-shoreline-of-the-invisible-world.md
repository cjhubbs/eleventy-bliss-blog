There's a beautiful bit in the [On Being episode](http://onbeing.org/program/john-o-donohue-the-inner-landscape-beauty/203) that was published earlier this week, from a 2008 interview that host Krista Tippett held with the late Irish poet [John O'Donohue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O%27Donohue).

This quote reminds me of a lot of what NT Wright says about the spiritual dimension and about churches being beachheads where God's kingdom overlaps and is shining into the world. Here's what O'Donohue said:

> The more I've been thinking about this, the way we make divisions all the time between the visible world and the invisible world, and it's as if the invisible world is the poor relation and the visible world is ultimate ground and reality, and the more I've been thinking about this the more it seems to me actually that the visible world is the first shoreline of the invisible world. And the same way, I believe, with the body and the soul - that actually the body is in the soul, not the soul just in the body - and that in some way the poignance of being a human being is that you are the place where the invisible becomes visible and expressive in some way.

"The poignance of being a human being is that you are the place where the invisible becomes visible and expressive in some way."

Beautiful.
