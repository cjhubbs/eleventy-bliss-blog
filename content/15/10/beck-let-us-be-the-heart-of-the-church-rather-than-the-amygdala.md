A really good reminder [from Richard Beck today](http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2015/10/let-us-be-heart-of-church-rather-than.html):

> ...it struck me how emotionally reactive we are to social media, our feelings getting jerked around by the latest thing that breaks on Twitter or Facebook. Sometimes it is happiness and euphoria. _Yay, our side is winning!_ Sometimes it is despondency and despair. _Oh no, the other side is winning!_ ... So let's remember the wisdom of Thérèse of Lisieux. Our vocation is to be the heart of the church, not the amygdala.

Yes and amen.
