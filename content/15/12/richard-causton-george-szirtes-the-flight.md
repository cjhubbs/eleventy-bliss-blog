For the past hour or so on this Christmas Eve morning we've been listening to the Nine Lessons and Carols service live on the BBC from Kings College Chapel in Cambridge. Beautiful stuff as you would expect - lovely choir, big organ, lots of scripture readings.

In addition to the traditional carols, though, there was a new carol, commissioned for this service. The text is from poet [George Szirtes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Szirtes), with music by [Richard Causton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Causton_%28composer%29). It's called [_The Flight_](http://blog.sinden.org/2015/12/causton-richard-flight.html).

> The child on the dirt path finds the highway blocked The dogs at the entrance snarl that doors are locked The great god of kindness has his kindness mocked _May those who travel light_ _Find shelter on the flight_ _May Bethlehem_ _Give rest to them._ The sea is a graveyard the beach is dry bones the child at the station is pelted with stones the cop stands impassive the ambulance drones We sleep then awaken we rest on the way our sleep might be troubled but hope is our day we move on for ever like children astray We move on for ever our feet leave no mark you won’t hear our voices once we’re in the dark but here is our fire this child is our spark.

Powerful stuff this Christmas.
