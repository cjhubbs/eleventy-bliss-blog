I really appreciated [this piece from Jonathan Aigner on Ponder Anew](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/ponderanew/2016/01/25/3-weak-arguments-against-contemporary-worship-music/) yesterday, wherein he suggests reframing so many of the discussions we have around music in the church.

For instance:

> **Bad Argument #1: Old songs are better.** This argument usually descends into warm, fuzzy reminiscences of singing in church with Grandma. That’s all fine and good, but it’s not enough... Some beloved old hymns feature terrible, vapid poetry paired with disjunct, noodly tunes, yet continue to find acceptance because their emotional appeal is so strong. Reframing this discussion: -Singing old songs (in addition to new ones) keeps us grounded in the history of our faith and connects us to those who have come before, reminding us that we’re not alone. -Singing old songs (in addition to new ones) protecting us from the sins of narcissism and chronological snobbery. -Singing old songs (in addition to new ones) expands our worship vocabulary, and steeps us in the language of our faith.

This is a beneficial approach; rather than focusing on arguments of preference we can discuss more significant issues that lie below the surface.

Aigner addresses these questions, too:

> **Bad Argument #2: The band is too loud.** **Bad Argument #3: I don’t like it.**

It's worth reading [the whole thing](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/ponderanew/2016/01/25/3-weak-arguments-against-contemporary-worship-music/).
