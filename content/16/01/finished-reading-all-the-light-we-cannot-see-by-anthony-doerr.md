I didn't get as much read on this business trip as I'd thought I might - French schedules have you eating dinner late with little time left for recreational reading before bed - but I did manage to finish [_All the Light We Cannot See_](http://amzn.to/1J4WvlO) by Anthony Doerr. This novel, set in WWII, tells the parallel stories of a blind French girl and a German boy with a precocious engineering streak.

It's a beautifully told story, capturing a smaller slice of life than you often get from a World War II novel. The intersections between the two main characters become clear by about half-way through the book, and I spent the rest of the time hoping against hope that the ending would be satisfactory. It was.

_All the Light We Cannot See_ won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and while I haven't read that much 2014/2015 fiction yet, I can understand why this one took the prize. Highly recommended.
