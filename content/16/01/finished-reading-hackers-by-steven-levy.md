I hadn't heard of this one prior to listening to an [Incomparable](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/) podcast episode last year - for the life of me I can't figure out which one - but it stocked my Amazon wish list with several tech history books, which my mother-in-law then generously gave me for Christmas.

In [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution](http://amzn.to/1ZNChAY), Levy tells the story of software hackers who for the most part aren't household names. Sure, there are quick mentions of Jobs, Wozniak, and Gates, but there are a dozen others you've never heard of who are similarly fascinating.

Levy talks quite a bit about the hacker ethos and principles that were pervasive from the early 1960s until, well, business and money got significantly involved in the late 1970s. It was a fun read for me since I recognize my own potential to become one of these heads-down, computer-obsessed hackers who barely notices when the sun rises or sets. (A course I have thankfully avoided thus far... for which my wife is both thankful and probably largely responsible.)

_Yes, I'm shamelessly picking up [John Halton's habit of blogging reading progress](http://johnthelutheran.tumblr.com/tagged/reading) this year, if for no other reason than it gives me 60+ additional posts a year... and maybe give a reader a good recommendation for a book to read. (Or to stay away from!)_
