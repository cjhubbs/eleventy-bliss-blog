So here's an idea: a sci-fi novel written by somebody who can actually write, with the physics and science worked out by a real nerd sidekick. That's what you get from _[Saturn Run](Saturn Run https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399176950/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awd_DzGHwbJ7YSH4D)_ by novelist John Sanford with help from sci-if nerd Ctein.Â   _Saturn Run_ is the book _The Martian_ wishes it could be if Andy Weir had a talent for prose. Great way to wind up my year of reading.
