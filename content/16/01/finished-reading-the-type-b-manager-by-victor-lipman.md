Being a recently new manager at work, and having a definite Type B personality, I saw _[The Type B Manager](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0735205434/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1452822158&sr=8-1&pi=SY200_QL40&keywords=the+type+b+manager)_ on the shelf and thought, hey, why not?

Now, books on management, in general, are a tough sell for me. After a lifetime of reading thick engineering, physics, history, and theology, management books seem relatively thin books and mostly a collection of platitudes and "well, duh" principles. But in an attempt to become a good manager, I keep giving them a try. 

_The Type B Manager_ was an exemplary specimen of this sort of thin platitude. Even in  trying to address Type B personalities, the book tends to describe the management challenge, what a Type A manager would do, and then how a Type B manager might handle it differently - a strategy that made the Type B personality seem like the poorer option. 

Maybe I just need to give up management books in general and spend more time reading [Rands](http://www.randsinrepose.com) instead.
