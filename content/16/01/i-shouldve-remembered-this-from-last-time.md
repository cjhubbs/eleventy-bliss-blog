This post serves simply as a reminder to myself that when a European immigration officer asks where I came from and then asks "by?" he doesn't want to know what Iowa is near to - he wants to know what cities my flight connected through.

And he'll get rather irritated if I don't pick up on that quickly.

On the other hand, if he can say "By? By? By?" with a little more rhythm, he might have a future on an 'N Sync reunion tour.
