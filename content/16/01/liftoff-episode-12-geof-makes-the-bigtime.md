When the Relay podcast guys announced a show about space, my first thought was "sure, [Stephen](https://twitter.com/ismh) and [Jason](https://twitter.com/jsnell) are great, but they need Geof as a third host". Well, he hasn't made it that far yet, but I was excited yesterday to see that he did make it on to [Liftoff episode 12](https://www.relay.fm/liftoff/12) as a guest.

Geof works at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, as a Payload Rack Officer for the International Space Station. I've heard bits and pieces about his job over the last year, but I learned a lot listening to him talk here. If you're interested in space, [Liftoff](https://www.relay.fm/liftoff) is worth a listen.
