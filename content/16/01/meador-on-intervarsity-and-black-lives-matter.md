Jake Meador over at Mere O has [a really good piece today](http://mereorthodoxy.com/on-intervarsity-and-black-lives-matter/) on the white evangelical response to the messages at Urbana last month, and more generally to the Black Lives Matter movement:

> We do not have to endorse everything about the organization Black Lives Matter. We shouldn’t feel like we cannot ask questions—even critical questions—about speeches like the one given by Michelle. But we also should not be instinctively suspicious of the claims of our black neighbors. Our nation’s history is such that we should have _no_ difficulty believing our black neighbors when they tell us about what life is like for black people in America today. Indeed, given our nation’s appalling history it would be more surprising if they _didn’t_ have any problems.

Definitely worth reading [the whole thing](http://mereorthodoxy.com/on-intervarsity-and-black-lives-matter/).
