2015 was another enjoyable year of reading for me, and with books [tracked as usual on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101?shelf=2015-reads), here's a short summary:

**Total books read:** 62. That's less than last year, but more than each of the three years before that. Fairly average for me.

**Fiction/non-fiction:** 36 / 26.

### Miscellaneous thoughts:

- **Won the "buy it for Dad for Christmas" award:** Desiring the Kingdom by James K.A. Smith.
- I'm honestly surprised by how _little_ theology I read this year. Seems like a lot less than previous years. Guess maybe I was ready for a break.
- Size of my unread book pile at the moment: embarrassingly large. Got 4 new books for Christmas. Added them to the pile. It's possible that by spring I'll need to go on another "no books from the library until the pile goes down" pledge. We'll see.

Do you have any recommendations for 2016 reading?
