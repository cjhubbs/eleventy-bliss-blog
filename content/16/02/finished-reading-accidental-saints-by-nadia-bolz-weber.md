This one was kinda hidden in those photos I posted yesterday. But after wading through Heim I was ready for a shorter, easy read, and [_Accidental Saints: Finding God in All the Wrong People_](http://amzn.to/1P8HVsN) by Lutheran pastor [Nadia Bolz-Weber](http://www.nadiabolzweber.com/) was just the ticket.

It's more of Nadia at her best, telling stories about her little parish in Denver and how she has experienced God at work in her life.

Nadia is a polarizing figure. Sure, you may have concerns about her attitude, language, and bits of her theology. Regardless, every time I hear or read her, I come away wishing that my faith, embrace of the Gospel, and walk with Jesus looked a little more like hers. That's enough for me.
