I've been interested in the Supreme Court ever since high school, so when I saw this one on the library shelf, I didn't hesitate in picking it up. Last year I read a book about Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice on the Supreme Court; this year I learn about the first two women to serve on that bench.

[_Sisters in Law: How Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg Went to the Supreme Court and Changed the World_](http://amzn.to/1QWw41q) is giving away a bit of its bias even in the title. It's a very nice history of these two groundbreaking women. It fascinated me to learn more about their backstories to add color to the faces you usually only see in stern portraits staring out from above black judicial robes.

It was interesting to learn about Ginsburg's path to the court and how it paralleled Thurgood Marshall's in many ways. Marshall was a tireless advocate for the African American cause as a lawyer before the Court before becoming a member; Ginsburg similarly championed the cause of equal rights for women. These backstories help remind us that even though the news stories about Court justices usually focus only on very recent legal opinions, appointment to the highest bench comes as the culmination of a long, brilliant legal career. These are impressive women with wonderful stories.

Author Hirshman is hardly a neutral observer here; she cheerleads for O'Connor and Ginsburg all through the volume. It's tolerable until the last few chapters, at which point she speaks so critically and dismissively of conservative justice Samuel Alito that I nearly decided to put the book down. The opening bulk of the book, though, made it worthwhile.
