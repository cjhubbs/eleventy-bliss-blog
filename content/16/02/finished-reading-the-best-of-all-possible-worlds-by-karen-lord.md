I picked this one off the New Books shelf at the library and was intrigued enough to borrow it. [_The Best of All Possible Worlds_](http://amzn.to/1SxWV7v) by Karen Lord is a gentle sci-fi story focused on culture exploration in the same vein of the later books of Orson Scott Card's _Ender_ series or some of the works of Ursula K. LeGuin. The cover blurb is a little bit misleading:

> A proud and reserved alien society finds its homeland destroyed in an unprovoked act of aggression...

Well, yeah... that happens on the first page. The remainder of the story is a more subtle story about relationships being built between different cultures. It was an enjoyable read.
