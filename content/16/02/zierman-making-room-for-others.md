Well, now, [this from Addie Zierman](http://offthepage.com/2016/02/24/making-room-for-others-on-the-spiral-labyrinth-of-faith/) is lovely:

> Our hearts are made like pendulums, and when we swing away from one thing, we tend to end up on the far opposite site. Passionate devotion to a certain viewpoint turns to total disdain, even embarrassment. _I can’t believe that used to make sense to me. I can’t believe I used to say “epic” so much. I can’t believe I wore a t-shirt with a giant bloody picture of Jesus on the cross on the front. To school. (“He did this for you,” the t-shirt said.)_ It’s easy to be hard on the person you were; it’s easier still to be hard on the people who are still there, who still see it this way, who still find comfort in the phrases that make you chafe. It’s easy to believe that they’re wrong and you’re right; that they’re stuck, and you’re enlightened. It’s easy to look back at them with a mix of pity and pride, as though they are somehow behind you on the journey. I don’t think that’s true.

A good reminder for all of us on our faith journeys. Worth reading [the whole thing](http://offthepage.com/2016/02/24/making-room-for-others-on-the-spiral-labyrinth-of-faith/).
