I had three books going in parallel before finishing these two, which was making me twitchy. (Now I'm back to one at a time. _Ahhhhh._)

#### [_The Bone Labyrinth_ by James Rollins](http://amzn.to/1pudi9v)

Random selection off the library shelf. Apparently this is number 11 in a series, but read fine as a stand-alone thriller. The writing itself was good, though the story was sort of a disappointing Michael Crichton / DaVinci Code mashup. Quick, reasonably entertaining read, but I find myself unlikely to pick up another one by Rollins.

#### [_Man Enough: How Jesus Redefines Manhood_ by Nate Pyle](http://amzn.to/1QY10yP)

In a generation of _Wild at Heart_\-esque books on Christian manhood, where wilderness adventure and military activity are primary examples pushed as "how to be more like a man", pastor Nate Pyle's book is a breath of fresh air. Pyle emphasizes gentleness, vulnerability, and a focus on the example of Jesus as better qualities to pursue. This is a short, easy read that I'd enjoy sneaking into a pastor's hand the next time they're pushing men's small groups.
