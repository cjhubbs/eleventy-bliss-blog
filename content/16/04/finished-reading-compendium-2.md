[_Quantum Night_ by Robert J. Sawyer](http://amzn.to/1NsQdsM)

I've been a fan of Sawyer's stuff to this point, and this one wasn't bad... but not great either. A sort of fascinating concept - quantum states within the brain as the cause of consciousness - but how it plays out is somewhat horrifying.

[_The Rising_ (Alchemy Series Book 2) by Ian Tregillis](http://amzn.to/23LbdEp)

This series continues to entertain.

[_The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It_ by Peter Enns](http://amzn.to/23Lburb)

This is Enns' popular-level treatment of the subject he's addressed in more scholarly detail elsewhere - namely, his take on how to interpret biblical (primarily Old Testament) texts that seem contradictory - whether that be contradicting other biblical texts, or the historical/archaeological record, or the conclusions of science. I appreciate that he wrote a popular-level book, and agree with many of his perspectives, but at times I wished he written it with more sensitivity towards those who are coming from a more conservative perspective. There's a lot of things along the lines of "of _course_ those are obviously contradictions, what's up with that?" sort of attitude that might turn off people who'd otherwise be helped by the book. Still, worth reading.

[_Beauty Will Save the World: Rediscovering the Allure and Mystery of Christianity_ by Brian Zahnd](http://amzn.to/23Let2K)

I picked this one up while attending Zahnd's prayer school a couple weeks ago. (Yeah, I need to write a separate post about that.) Here Zahnd urges us to rediscover the _beauty_ of Christian belief from amidst the American Christian culture's desire to over-analyze and have an explanation for everything. The last two chapters alone were completely worth the price of the book. Good stuff.
