Today is May 4th, which has gained an online buzz as "Star Wars Day" - "May the Fourth be with you" and all that. (My friend Geof isn't a fan, but we all knew he'd become a curmudgeon sooner or later.)

A better idea, though, came through on Twitter this morning:

(Thanks, Bethany, for RTing that into my timeline!)

So, in honor of 5/4 day, my favorite 5/4 song that isn't [Take Five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs):

Hapyp 5/4 day, everybody!
