I've gotten really bad at blogging through all my reading, mostly because it drives me crazy when all I have on this blog is post after post of 'here's what I read'.

Now that I have a few other posts under my belt, here's a quick list of my more recent reading:

#### [_Version Control_ by Dexter Palmer](http://amzn.to/25cDFzM)

Trippy time travel / multiverse novel. Not bad.

#### [_Scalia Dissents: Writings of the Supreme Court's Wittiest, Most Outspoken Justice_, edited by Kevin Ring](http://amzn.to/1Vg1OCT)

Scalia's opinions and wit: fantastic reading. The editor's heavy-handed, fawning commentary: not so much. Call it a mixed bag.

#### [_The Prophetic Imagination_ by Walter Brueggemann](http://amzn.to/1U7gTkV)

A classic, and quite timely.

#### [_Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology_ by Leah Remini](http://amzn.to/25cDjcE)

Just in case you'd ever wondered if Scientology was really _that_ messed up. Answer: yes.

#### [_No Country for Old Men_ by Cormac McCarthy](http://amzn.to/1U7gPBM)

An American classic. Though I can't read the book now without seeing [Javier Bardem's face as Anton Chigurh](http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/anton.jpg).

#### [_Orphan X (Evan Smoak, #1)_ by Gregg Hurwitz](http://amzn.to/1TzJbY1)

As dime-a-dozen action novels go, not bad.

#### [_An Altar in the World: A Geography of Faith_ by Barbara Brown Taylor](http://amzn.to/2451UO1)

A meditation on living a truly _embodied_ faith. Beautiful stuff.

#### [_Reading Revelation Responsibly: Uncivil Worship and Witness: Following the Lamb into the New Creation_ by Michael J. Gorman](http://amzn.to/1Vg1ynu)

[I wrote about this one already.](/16/05/reading-revelation-responsibly-by-michael-j-gorman/)

#### [_Look Who's Back_ by Timur Vermes](http://amzn.to/1TzJfHw)

A friend recommended this one. Premise: Adolf Hitler wakes up in the present day and grapples with modern life and social media. Hitler: YouTube star? Not as crazy as it sounds.

#### [_The Ottoman Endgame: War, Revolution, and the Making of the Modern Middle East, 1908 - 1923_ by Sean McMeekin](http://amzn.to/1WdSAbn)

Filling in a gap in the history I'm familiar with. Very readable account of the end of the Ottoman Empire.

#### [_All the Pretty Horses_ by Cormac McCarthy](http://amzn.to/1Vg1Rys)

Oh goodness me I love what McCarthy does with words.
