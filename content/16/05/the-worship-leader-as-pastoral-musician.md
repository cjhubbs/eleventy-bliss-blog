[Zac Hicks shared this video last week](http://www.zachicks.com/blog/2016/5/17/watch-the-fascinating-discussions-i-had-at-calvin.html) - it's a two-hour long panel discussion at Calvin College on the topic of "The Worship Leader as Pastoral Musician". The panel includes worship pastors from a wide variety of backgrounds and an academic who has made a study of evangelical church music.

I'm only 30 minutes into it so far but I've already noted several timestamps that I want to go back and transcribe and write more about... this is a really good discussion. Worth two hours if you've got them.
