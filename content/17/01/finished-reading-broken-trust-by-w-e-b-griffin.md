I got sucked into Griffin's Badge of Honor series years ago. This is book #13, and the hero is still only 27 years old, and opens the story still suffering from the wound he suffered in book #12. Hey, if Griffin is still making money cranking these out at age 87, good for him. But let's not pretend they're any more substantive entertainment than your average 1.5-star franchise action movie. Meh.
