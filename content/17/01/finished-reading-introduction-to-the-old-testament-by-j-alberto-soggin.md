[John Halton's review](http://johnthelutheran.tumblr.com/post/153487407991/finished-reading-introduction-to-the-old) set me on this one, and I had much the same response to it that he did. Soggin's work looks at the Old Testament from a historical perspective and dives heavily into textual criticism.

It is eye-opening for this conservative evangelical to see how far the academically-accepted historical background of the OT differs from the one we are taught by our church leaders, but rather than causing me to look askance at the OT now, it causes me to appreciate more how God has brought together these texts in a way that is meaningful for us as believers today. (It also cements in my mind that defining "infallibility" for the Scriptures is an impossible task, and that "inspired" or "God-breathed" makes much more sense.)

Glad I read this one... and ready for something a little less academic now as a palate cleanser.
