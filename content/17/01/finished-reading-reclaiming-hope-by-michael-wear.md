The buzz on this one had been going around Twitter for a while, so I was glad to pick up a copy and read. [Michael Wear](http://michaelwear.com/) is a young guy who, not even out of college, worked as the White House lead for evangelical outreach during President Obama's first term. _Reclaiming Hope_ is part memoir of those years and partly Wear's suggestions for how to repair political engagement with religion.

On the whole, I think Wear did a good job of identifying points where both the right and left failed in opportunities to find common ground that could've made legitimate progress on issues important to religious conservatives. However, I think his admiration for President Obama causes him to pull his punches in the second half of the book.

In the first half of the book, Wear reveals himself as something of an Obama fan boy as he details all of the President's speeches that reveal the depth to his personal faith. (I'm not disputing these - I have great admiration for Obama's faith - but the tone is pretty fawning.) When Wear starts assigning blame in the second half of the book, though, the blame is never to Obama directly, but always to the "administration" or the "White House".

Overall, it's a good little memoir, and Wear has some good thoughts to share about how we might find progress forward on issues significant to people of faith.
