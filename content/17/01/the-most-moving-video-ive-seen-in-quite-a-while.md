President Obama awards VP Joe Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of his 40 years of public service. Biden has no idea the award is coming. Agree with their politics or not, these are respectable men who have each served their country well.

The friendship and love they have for each other is remarkable and touching. It's hard not to contrast Biden's evident humility with the arrogant bluster we so often hear from the next resident of the White House.
