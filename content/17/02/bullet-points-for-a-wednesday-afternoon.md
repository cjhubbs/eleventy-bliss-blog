- I'm glad I signed up for the 0530 kickboxing class, but it'd really help if I'd go to bed earlier at night. Short sleep + workouts = ouch.
- Also = zzzzzz. The folks at the coffee stand know my order (large Americano) now and have it going when I walk up.
- Not so great: realizing 45 minutes in that what you thought was a one-hour Webex meeting is actually a two-hour Webex meeting.
- Better: having said two-hour Webex meeting only take an hour.
- My diet that's supposed to be accompanying my kickboxing class isn't helped when my wife buys two-pound cinnamon rolls from the local bakery.
- I've been busy enough lately that I started drafting this on Tuesday morning and just finally published it on Wednesday afternoon.
- On balance, I'm not really complaining about the cinnamon roll.
