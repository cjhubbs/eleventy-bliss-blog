Another random library selection, and a nice change of pace from history and theology. In _Now_, Cal Berkeley professor Richard Muller sets out to provide a layman's-level discussion of the nature of time and how the domain of physics interacts with and helps explain it.

Muller provides an engaging discussion about relativistic time dilation, the big bang, quantum effects and "spooky action at a distance", and his own thoughts about what it is that causes time to move only forward. It's not entirely for the faint of heart, but he at least is good enough to leave his derivation of equations into appendices rather than embedding them within the body text. The Goodreads reviews of the book seem to be a bunch of physics nerds giving the author flack for his approach, but to this engineering nerd who isn't deep into physics, it was just fine.
