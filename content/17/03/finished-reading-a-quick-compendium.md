Because I've been lazy and not keeping up:

[_The Big Screen: The Story of the Movies - and What They Have Done to Us_](http://amzn.to/2nbjntH) by David Thomson An extensive trip through the history of filmmaking. I'm interested in movies far more than I get the opportunity to watch them, so this was an interesting read and gives me lots of movie watching gaps to fill in.

[_City of Dreams: The 400-Year Epic History of Immigrant New York_](http://amzn.to/2m1iaFz) by Tyler Anbinder This came on the tail of visiting Manhattan for a week for work. A really fascinating read starting with the first white settlers in New York and carrying on through the late 20th century.

[_The Believer_](http://amzn.to/2nbbh4m) by Joakim Zander A thriller novel that hits a little too close to home, including a wanna-be jihadist and shady government forces at work.

[_Last Year_](http://amzn.to/2n0u2qw) by Robert Charles Wilson A time-travel novel in which the present day has a gate into one possible past, but only to a specific time the 1870s. More thoughtful than I anticipated.

[_Dune_](http://amzn.to/2n0FKl7) by Frank Herbert Caught up with a classic I'd never read. Really enjoyed it. Now I suppose I'll get sucked into the whole series.
