One of my favorites, Brian Zahnd, talked recently on the [Makers and Mystics podcast](http://www.makersandmystics.com/makersandmystics/2017/3/22/season-2-e-5-beauty-will-save-the-world-part-2). I love this little bit of what he had to say about the church being "from the future":

> When I say I'm from the future, what I mean is that in baptism I have come to live under the reign and rule of Christ here and now. And I use an illustration: this is what the Church should be like. If you go to a movie, and you're there to see, well, whatever you're there to see, everybody knows that before the actual movie starts you have the previews. And what a preview is, is 2, 3, 4 minutes of a coming attraction. This movie is not here yet, but they're going to show you enough of it that you get an idea of what it will be like. The church is to be a preview of the age to come. We're not perfect, we don't claim that. But we should be able - I don't think we really can, for the most part - but we should be able to say to the wider culture, "look at our communities. This is where this thing is headed. This is what the reign of Christ actually looks like, because we are from the future, we are embodying that here and now."

So good.
