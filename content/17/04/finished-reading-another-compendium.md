If I posted these individually when I finished the books, I'd have more frequent posts on the blog here... oh well.

**[_Before the Fall_](http://amzn.to/2otcGnU) by Noah Hawley** An interesting little thriller / mystery about a man who survives a private plane crash. Not as thrilling or involved as it could be, but good basic entertainment. I hear that this guy is writing for the TV show Legion, which leads me to think I should maybe give it a try.

**[_The Girl Who Drank the Moon_](http://amzn.to/2n42jXr) by Kelly Barnhill** I saw this one was a fantasy story that had won the Newbery, so I figured I'd give it a shot in hopes of finding something I could give my daughters to read. It's a nice story, a little bit dark in places but with hopeful messages. It's not as funny as a Terry Pratchett or Neil Gaiman story, and there's a lot going on in it. I think my older two daughters would probably handle it OK, but at the moment I can't manage to get either of them interested in it. Oh well.

**[_A Natural History of the Piano: The Instrument, the Music, the Musicians--from Mozart to Modern Jazz and Everything in Between_](http://amzn.to/2otfpgQ) by Stuart Isacoff** Picked this one up on a whim and enjoyed it. Basically it's a short history not just of the development of the piano as an instrument but also of the composers and musicians who used it. My favorite part of reading books about music like this is that I'm always pointed to some new music. This time the bit of interest is Shostakovich's 24 Preludes and Fugues, a cycle modeled after Bach's. Now if only the sheet music wasn't nearly $100...
