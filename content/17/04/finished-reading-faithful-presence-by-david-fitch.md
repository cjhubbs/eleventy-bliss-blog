I've kept up with David Fitch for a while now via his blog and twitter. Fitch is a professor of theology at Northern Seminary in suburban Chicago, and has led church plants that reflect his focus on community, mutual leadership and submission, and reconciliation. [_Faithful Presence_](http://amzn.to/2nfTk5e) seeks to capture those ideas in a short, practical volume for church leaders.

Fitch outlines three areas of presence that Christians should occupy: the "close circle" (presence with other Christians around the Lord's Supper), the "dotted circle" (still a fellowship of believers, but open to non-believers, typically in the context of a believer's home), and the "half circle" (extending Christian presence into the neighborhood).

He then spends short chapters on each of seven disciplines he outlines as critical to a faithful presence. They are:

- The Lord's Table
- Reconciliation
- Proclaiming the Gospel
- Being with the "Least of These"
- Being with Children
- The Fivefold gifting (roles in church leadership)
- Kingdom Prayer

I really like Fitch's focus on neighborhood and community presence; this is a welcome redirection from the big evangelical church as social hub. I found resonance there with an end note from [Nadia Bolz-Weber's _Accidental Saints_](/16/02/finished-reading-accidental-saints-by-nadia-bolz-weber/), where (if memory serves) she says essentially "do you want what we have? Don't move here and come to my church - instead, start having a weekly dinner in your home with other believers, and let it grow from there."

There's a lot here to consider in an easy, small volume. Worth the read.
