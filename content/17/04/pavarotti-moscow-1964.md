So I'm not really an opera guy but this video of Luciano Pavarotti singing in Moscow in 1964 is amazing nevertheless.

It's a little odd seeing him so young (age 29 or so), with no beard, and his eyebrow action is, well, non-trivial, but the level of vocal control is ridiculously impressive.

Worth the 3 minutes to watch.
