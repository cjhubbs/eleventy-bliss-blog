Finished reading:

Since I can't seem to get individual posts written...

**[_The Silk Roads: A New History of the World_](http://amzn.to/2pA4Jge) by Peter Frankopan**

A short history of the world as viewed with the Persia / India / China Silk Road corridor as the center of the action. Interesting in parts, though was far more of an overview than I was expecting. Now I need to go back and read some Persian and Chinese history.

**[_Born to Run_](http://amzn.to/2pA91V6) by Bruce Springsteen**

An autobiography by the famed rock-and-roller. An enjoyable read that sure seems to have his sense of style... no ghost writing here. I've never followed Springsteen's music closely but it was fascinating to read his story.

**[_Dorothy Day: The World Will Be Saved by Beauty: An Intimate Portrait of My Grandmother_](http://amzn.to/2pA8z99) by Kate Hennessy**

A portrait of Catholic radical Dorothy Day as written by her granddaughter. While this book might add a lot of color for someone already very familiar with Day's story and importance, to somebody like me who wasn't familiar with her _at all_, it focused far more on their bizarre (and usually bleak) living and family arrangements. Could've been more accurately subtitled _A Family Picture from the Perspective of Day's Daughter, Who Was (Rightly) Put Off by Most of It_.

**[_Boeing Versus Airbus: The Inside Story of the Greatest International Competition in Business_](http://amzn.to/2pAjksa) by John Newhouse**

Interesting to me primarily because I work in the industry. The book is 10 years old - would be interesting to read an update now that Boeing's 787 has made it to the field.

**[_Liturgy of the Ordinary: Sacred Practices in Everyday Life_](http://amzn.to/2pnb4ek) by Tish Harrison Warren**

Now this is a lovely little book. Warren, an Anglican priest from Austin, Texas, looks at how our mundane daily practices can make us mindful of God in our lives and how spiritual disciplines include mindfulness of the little things in life. An encouraging read that was over far too quickly.
