Grabbed this one off the library shelf on a whim. I read Kostova's _The Historian_ a few years back and remember enjoying it, and I was ready for some fiction.

First comment on this one: bet you've never read a book set in modern Bulgaria before! (Kostova is an American but is married to a Bulgarian, hence her interest in the region.) The novel flashes back and forth between present-day and early Cold War-era Bulgaria to tell the story of a family and their suffering under Communist rule.

I didn't find it as intense or engaging as _The Historian_, but Kostova writes beautifully and the story kept me going until the last page. Not a bad choice for some casual reading.
