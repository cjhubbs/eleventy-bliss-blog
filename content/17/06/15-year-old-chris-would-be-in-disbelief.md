File this under "things that would've stunned the 15-year-old Chris".

As a teenager, the evangelical Christian culture we were in lionized people like Jay Sekulow. He founded the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), which was out there fighting against the secular world to protect Christians' rights. He argued and won a 9-0 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed Jews for Jesus could distribute evangelistic pamphlets at Los Angeles International Airport. A sterling example for Christian young people to look up to.

At the same time, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was spoken of with disgust. Anti-Christian. There to take away our religious liberty. Thank God we have people like Jay Sekulow to fight them on our behalf.

Fast-forward 25 years.

We now have a President who has [been described by Jerry Fallwell Jr. as "evangelicals' dream president"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/05/04/their-dream-president-trump-just-gave-white-evangelicals-a-big-boost/?utm_term=.3ca22cec20a4). In that president's flurry of anti-immigrant activity, [Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now looking to deport more than 100 Iraqi Christians](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/aclu-files-against-ice-for-iraqi-nationals/index.html), most of whom have been in the country legally for many years, and send them back to Iraq where they are a heavily persecuted minority.

Wait, what? Christians immigrants being deported? Where are the religious liberty groups like the ACLJ and our brave heroes like Jay Sekulow?

Oh, that's right: Sekulow is currently a [part of the President's legal team and is making the rounds of the Sunday news talk shows arguing with TV hosts](http://www.businessinsider.com/jay-sekulow-new-face-trump-legal-team-russia-2017-6) about why the President's tweets saying "I am under investigation" don't really mean that he's under investigation.

And who is standing up for the Iraqi Christians?

[The ACLU.](https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-sues-stop-deportation-iraqis-targeted-weekend-ice-raids)

Yes, I know all the objections that will come back to this. Not all evangelicals. Franklin Graham actually broke with the President on this one. Some of the deportees have criminal records. The ACLU supports some causes I disapprove of. Etc, etc.

But really, this is such a stunning reversal of positions (or at least, my perception of those positions) over the past couple decades that it's enough to set my head spinning. It also makes me happy to have set up a recurring monthly donation to the ACLU.
