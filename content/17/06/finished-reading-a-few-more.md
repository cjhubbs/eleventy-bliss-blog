Summertime seems to make it hard to get through too many, but here are a few more books that I've finished over the past few weeks...

**[_Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich_](http://amzn.to/2u8vNSG) by Norman Ohler**

Ohler's book is partly a technical explanation of the development of opiates and methamphetamines by German pharmaceutical companies and partly a chronicle of Hitler's descent into the hell of addiction. A stunning picture of horror and madness.

**[_The Imperfect Disciple: Grace for People Who Can't Get Their Act Together_](http://amzn.to/2tcTYTP) by Jared C. Wilson**

A beautiful little volume that calls readers back to the spiritual disciplines in a way that is gracious and encouraging.

**[_The Givenness of Things_](http://amzn.to/2taJmEj) by Marilynne Robinson**

I've posted [several quotes](/17/06/marilynne-robinson-on-cultural-pessimism/) [from this book](/17/06/sabbath-is-a-way-of-life/) [already](/17/06/the-extraordinary-moment/), and should really queue up several more. Robinson's essays are so thoughtful and engaging. Finding someone who unashamedly professes a belief in orthodox Christianity while at the same time discussing that faith in terms and from angles that are far outside traditional theological writing is a huge treat. Destined to be one of my favorite books of the year.
