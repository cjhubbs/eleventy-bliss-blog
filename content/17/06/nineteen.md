Nineteen years ago today Becky and I were married. If I search back through the archives on this blog I'm sure I'd find that I have used the same phrases almost every year. Yes, it was a hot day. Yes, we were young. No, we really didn't know what we were getting into.

But nineteen years later I can say I have been immeasurably blessed by having Becky as my wife and best friend. Three kids, four homes, a dozen or so cats, and hundreds of softball games later we are stronger, closer, and more content than I think we have ever been.

Here's to many, many more. Years, that is. And softball games. (Maybe not too many more cats?)
