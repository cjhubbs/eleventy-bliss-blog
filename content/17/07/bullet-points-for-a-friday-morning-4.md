Hey, it's Friday.

- The weather is really too nice to be sitting in the office all day today. I might have to do something about that.
- My oldest daughter is in the College for Kids program at Coe College this week and next. One of the classes she's taking is Web Design, and I had a proud nerd dad moment when she told me she was ahead of the rest of the class because she already knew some HTML.
- It's amazing how a shower, shave, some weights at the gym, and it being FRIDAY helps a guy's general outlook.
- Reading through Matthew in my reading plan the past couple weeks and I have started highlighting every place that Jesus heals someone. I have green highlights now on almost every page. Setting things right, indeed.
- The back-and-forth the past few days over Eugene Peterson's comments regarding homosexuality and gay marriage have been enlightening and saddening. I feel mostly like the big evangelical machine took advantage of an old saint who deserves better treatment. Ugh.
- How is it mid-July already?
- My friend Lyz wrote [this piece](http://therumpus.net/2015/05/my-sisters-legs/) a couple years ago about her sisters and a major car accident. It's a beautiful piece of writing.
- It's been a fairly quiet summer event-wise, but in September Becky and I have tickets for concerts two weekends in a row: U2 in St. Louis, and Andrew Peterson's Rich Mullins tribute concert in Nashville. Now to figure out what we're doing with the kids.
- I'm leading worship this weekend, but apparently I haven't thought much about it yet because the worship leader disaster dreams haven't started yet. Probably tonight.
- There's a lot of pain in this world. Be kind.
