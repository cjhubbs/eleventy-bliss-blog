I've read Christian authors from time to time who seem to be flirting with Buddhism - I guess I'm thinking primarily of Thomas Merton and Richard Rohr - and I've never really understood the appeal.

Then yesterday while mowing the lawn I listened to [Krista Tippett's interview with Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard](https://onbeing.org/programs/matthieu-ricard-happiness-as-human-flourishing/) and was captivated. In an hour discussion (I listen to On Being's unedited versions, always) Ricard shared thought after thought about human flourishing and connectedness and joy and contentment that, with just the tweaking of a few phrases, could've been directly from Christian teaching.

Now, nobody freak out, I'm not off to shave my head buy a robe and become a monk. But if you have a spare hour, this interview was well worth listening to.
