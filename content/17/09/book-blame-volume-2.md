Once again it's time to blame thank the people that recommend books that provoke me to purchase things from Amazon.

In this case, I have a couple places to give credit. The latest book headed my way from Amazon is _The Orthodox Way_ by Bishop Kallistos Ware. This was driven by a tweet from Graham Ware:

After reading and really enjoying some David Bentley Hart, it's probably time for me to explore some more Orthodox authors.

I'm also going to assign some blame to Amazon for this one - they recently sent me a gift card paying out for some Amazon Associates link clicks which was enough to buy the book. Woohoo!
