Andrew Osenga started a new podcast earlier this year called [The Pivot](http://www.andrewosenga.com/podcast/). Episode 3 is his discussion with musician, producer, and composer [Don Chaffer](https://twitter.com/donchaffer). Toward the end of the interview, Don talks about how he's started writing for musical theater, and how it provides an outlet that he needs as a 40-ish father and husband.

> ...when you have kids in particular you just give and give and give and give. And one day you wake up and you're like 'what do I get, what's my part in this thing? Because I used to do a lot of stuff I liked... sometimes I would go out to eat or watch a movie! That was crazy!'. I told a monk friend of mine one time, he said 'tell me everything'. And I said 'well I feel like between family and work I've got nothing left.' And he said "yeah! and a hundred years ago you'd be dead by now, too." So, there's just something about this phase of life, it's just - he's like, 'people died at that point just because they were too pooped to keep living'. And I feel like - so that's what a mid-life crisis is. You hit these limitations and you think 'I'd rather have, you know, a Corvette and a hot blonde with a boob job. And so you do these crazy stupid things, blow up your whole life. And it's like -- one of the jokes I've made is that my mid-life crisis was music theater instead of hookers and blow. But it's true. I think that it became - one of the things I realized is that you find a healthy outlet to give yourself some space, to do some things you enjoy. Because that's important. You can't live on only sacrifice. It ends up being a negation. While love and sacrificial love are endless, hypothetically, they aren't for a human, right? They're only endless because they come from somewhere else. There's some point you kinda run yourself out and you realize 'I don't have infinite capacity here to be a loving husband and father. I've gotta do something for myself.' The other piece of it for a marriage is to try to invite each other into it together. Not necessarily doing the same things, because usually that isn't going to help - you need space from each other - but invite each other into that headspace of like, 'do some things for yourself. I'll do some things for myself. We'll get a babysitter if we can afford it. Or swap. I'll take the kids tonight, you take them on Wednesday.'

I resonate with that more than I'd like to admit many days. (I bet my wife does, too.)
