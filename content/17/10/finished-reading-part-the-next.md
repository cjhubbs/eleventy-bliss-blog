A rundown of recent book completions:

**[_A People's History of Christianity: The Other Side of the Story_](http://amzn.to/2yBvPsR) by Diana Butler Bass**

Bass is clearly giving a nod to Zinn's _People's History of the United States_ with her title and approach. It's not a bad effort, but nothing really earth-shattering, either.

**[_The Art of Curating Worship: Reshaping the Role of Worship Leader_](http://amzn.to/2xtRIFe) by Mark Pierson**

Pierson is an Australian who was writing from a very strong emergent perspective. While the worship experiences he describes are a long way from what would work in my midwestern US church, his perspective on the intent of and attitude toward leading worship was right on and gave me a lot to think about.

**[_Khrushchev: The Man and His Era_](http://amzn.to/2xsJ7Yh) by William Taubman**

A very readable biography of the Soviet leader. Still hard to get a grasp on how someone can be so human and yet so depraved.

**[_Parable of the Sower_](http://amzn.to/2yAB1gi) by Octavia E. Butler**

This was the first I've read of Butler. Won't be the last. A wonderful voice in dystopian fiction.

**[_Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness_](http://amzn.to/2xtHZiq) by Edward Kaplan**

The first of two volumes of biography of a fascinating Jewish thinker from the early 20th century. Now I've gotta get volume two.

**[_The Switch_](http://amzn.to/2xtPru1) by Joseph Finder**

I was wanting mindless entertainment, and this book overachieved at that. By which I mean it was even more mindless and boring than I was hoping for. Meh.
