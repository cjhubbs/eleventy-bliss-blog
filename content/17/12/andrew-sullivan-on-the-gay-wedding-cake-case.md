I miss Andrew Sullivan. I'm glad the guy detached a bit - the pace of his daily blogging was incredible, no surprise it wasn't sustainable - but he has a unique and important voice on issues of our time. So it was no surprise to me that his weekly column addressing the Gay Wedding Cake case is a must read.

I find myself pretty much in alignment with Andrew's conflicted take. I'd highly recommend reading [the whole thing](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/andrew-sullivan-let-him-have-his-cake.html) - it's not too long - but I'll quote just one pithy paragraph.

> In other words, if the liberals were more liberal, and the Christians more Christian, this case would never have existed. It tells you a great deal about the decadence of our culture that it does.
