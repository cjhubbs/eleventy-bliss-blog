I’ve gotten seriously slack at listing all the books I’ve been reading. Consider this my year-end catch-up post. (Not to be confused with my year-in-review post which will come next week sometime.)

Here’s what I’ve finished reading since last time I posted:

### Fiction

- _City of Stairs_ by Robert Jackson Bennett
- _Boneshaker_ by Cherie Priest
- _Autonomous_ by Annalee Newitz
- _The Berlin Project_ by Gregory Benford
- _Over Sea, Under Stone_ by Susan Cooper
- _The Force_ by Don Winslow
- _The Quantum Spy_ by David Ignatius

### Non-Fiction

- _A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples_ by Ilan Pappe
- _Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America, 1940-1972_ by Edward K. Kaplan
- _Sinners in the Hands of a Loving God_ by Brian Zahnd
- _The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency_ by Chris Whipple
- _How to Think_ by Alan Jacobs

I’m currently reading _The Punch Escrow_ by Tal M. Klein, which if it stays on track will climb pretty high up my favorites list for the year. Stay tuned!
