![](/images/2017/politics-150x150.jpg)From time to time over the past year when I've been tempted to write political rage posts, it has seemed to me that even though they'd be cathartic, that wouldn't be all that constructive. And while I haven't studied political theory or public policy much, writing helps me work through my thinking on issues. So, my thought goes, maybe I should spend some time thinking through and writing constructive opinions on various political topics.

Then I came across this tweet from [Brian Zahnd](https://twitter.com/BrianZahnd/) (this was before my social media fast, honest!) that seems like a good framework to work from:

Off the top of my head, some topics I'd like to consider:

- Taxation
- Religious Liberty
- Health Care
- Gun control
- Foreign trade policy
- Foreign military presence
- Middle East policy / terrorism
- Racial justice issues
- Social programs / social safety net
- Education
- Internet / technology policy
- Campaign finance
- Term limits
- Science & space
- Environmental issues

I'm not working through this all to get Brian Zahnd's vote - I'd need to run for office first! But it might be constructive to think positively about what policy should be instead of just saying "well, _that's_ a bad idea".
