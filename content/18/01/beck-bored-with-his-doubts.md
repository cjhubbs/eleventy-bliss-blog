> The trouble with the incessant deconstruction at work within progressive Christianity is that, left unchecked, all it tends to produce are agnostic Democrats.

Strong words from one of my favorites, [Richard Beck](http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2018/01/journal-week-3-losing-interest-in.html), this morning. Beck observes that the continual deconstruction of progressive Christianity doesn't necessarily end, well, Christianly. And he does so in his typical relaxed fashion.

> I remain very sympathetic to progressive Christianity. But a Christianity that doesn't believe in anything--a Christianity that dilutes and dilutes and dilutes until you have a "Church of Christ Without Christ"--that Christianity just doesn't interest me anymore. I've made a long and hard journey carrying my doubts, and now I'm just bored by them.
