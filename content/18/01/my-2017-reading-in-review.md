Just a quick post to summarize my reading and a few favorites this year. I read [a total of 71 books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?shelf=2017-reads) in 2017, which I'll split up into fiction, non-fiction, and theology. I'll highlight no more than two in each category as particular favorites.

### Fiction

- _Broken Trust_ - W.E.B. Griffin
- _Bounty_ - Michael Byrnes
- _The Whistler_ - John Grisham
- _The Believer_ - Joakim Zander
- _Last Year_ - Robert Charles Wilson
- _Dune_ - Frank Herbert
- _Before the Fall_ - Noah Hawley
- _The Girl Who Drank the Moon_ - Kelly Barnhill
- _The Shadow Land_ - Elizabeth Kostova

- **_The Force_ - Don Winslow**
- _The Quantum Spy_ - David Ignatius

_The Force_ is a well-written crime story featuring a flawed detective. A really engaging page-turner where I didn't know where the story was going when I was half-way through.

_The Punch Escrow_ is a sci-fi thriller that takes one reasonable conceit and runs with it to great effect. A really fun novel to close out the year.

### Non-Fiction

- **_How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds_ - Alan Jacobs**
- _The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency_ - Chris Whipple
- _Nevertheless: A Memoir_ - Alec Baldwin

I started off the year with a bang reading Ibram X. Kendi's _Stamped from the Beginning_. Stunning writing about the history of racism in America. So much that we as middle-class white Americans aren't familiar with. But the one that will likely stick with me even more and provoke some re-reads came late in the year: Alan Jacobs' _How to Think_. In this time of "fake news" and incessant online argument, Jacobs provides some much-needed sanity and advice.

### Theology

- _How to Survive a Shipwreck_ - Jonathan Martin
- _Introduction to the Old Testament_ - J. Alberto Soggin
- _The Day the Revolution Began: Reconsidering the Meaning of Jesus's Crucifixion_ - N.T. Wright
- _Faithful Presence: Seven Disciplines that Shape the Church for Mission_ - David E. Fitch
- _Liturgy of the Ordinary: Sacred Practices in Everyday Life_ - Tish Harrison Warren
- _The Imperfect Disciple: Grace for People Who Can't Get Their Act Together_ - Jared C. Wilson
- _People to Be Loved: Why Homosexuality Is Not Just an Issue_ - Preston Sprinkle
- **_The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?_ - David Bentley Hart**
- **_Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony_ - Richard Bauckham**
- _A People's History of Christianity: The Other Side of the Story_ - Diana Butler Bass
- _The Art of Curating Worship: Reshaping the Role of Worship Leader_ - Mark Pierson
- _Sinners in the Hands of a Loving God: The Scandalous Truth of the Very Good News_ - Brian Zahnd

_Jesus and the Eyewitnesses_ by Richard Bauckham will permanently change how I read the Gospels. His case that most people named by name in the Gospels were specifically named because they were known eyewitnesses puts the accounts in a new light.

And I had heard good stuff about D.B. Hart's little volume _The Doors of the Sea_ for a long time but just never gotten to it. In it he uses the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 to frame his response to the age-old question of how a good, omnipotent God can allow such evil and suffering. My theological upbringing has been pretty Calvinist, but Hart's very non-Calvinist approach (he's Orthodox) provided a more compelling and beautiful explanation than anything I've previously read.

### Summary

On the whole, I feel like I got a lot of variety this year and read a lot of interesting books. I do have a handful that I started and for some reason bogged down in and need to come back to - Greg Boyd's _Crucifixion of the Warrior God_ is on that list... to be picked up sometime soon.
