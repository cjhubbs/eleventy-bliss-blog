It's grey outside and I'm on business travel all week. Bring on the bullet points!

- I'm ready to be done with this head cold. Bleh.
- Normally on a business trip I'd be looking for a nice restaurant to hit for supper. Given that today is Valentine's Day, I expect they're all gonna be crazy busy tonight. I think I'll hit the mall food court instead.
- Here's hoping my 11-year-old remembers to give her mom the card I left with her.
- Oh and it's Ash Wednesday. Thinking I'll go to a service tonight.
- I can't remember the last time I've really gotten into a new album. Probably when the Hamilton soundtrack came out a couple years ago. As a guy who used to be buying a new CD every month or so this seems sad.
- I gotta set myself a reminder that I'm leading worship this weekend... have everything planned but need to do some mental rehearsal.
- Pitchers and catchers report today. Looking forward to another good season for the Cubs!
- Before Hamilton, the last record I really fell in love with was Arcade Fire's _The Suburbs_.
- Wordsmithing documents in a 20-person committee is quite an experience.
- Is it lunchtime yet?
