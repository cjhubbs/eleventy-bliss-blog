How long must we continue to sacrifice children on the altar of the Second Amendment?

As Christians, being "pro-life" must extend beyond the unborn life to care for _all_ of life. Do we love our guns so much that we are [unwilling to even allow studies of gun violence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/04/gun-violence-research-has-been-shut-down-for-20-years/)?

We must be Christians first and Americans later. Do we really think Jesus would say [the solution is _more_ guns](https://www.cnn.com/2012/12/21/us/connecticut-school-shooting/index.html)?

Don't say that we shouldn't get political with our Christianity. Christian beliefs have political implications. As N. T. Wright says, to declare "Jesus is Lord" is to inherently say that "Caesar is not". Our priorities and attitudes should be shaped by the Sermon on the Mount before the Bill of Rights.

Enough is enough. I'm not saying there is an easy solution, but allowing the unchecked proliferation of guns cannot be the answer.
