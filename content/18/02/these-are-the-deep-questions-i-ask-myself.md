The other night we were playing "Name that Disney movie" while shuffling soundtracks on Spotify. The question I have rattling around in my head two days later is this:

Do I like the _Moana_ songs so much because I like their distinctive style? Because I _do_ think that Lin-Manuel Miranda's approach feels and sounds very different than what, say, Robert Lopez and Kristin Anderson-Lopez do in _Frozen_ or what Randy Newman does in half the Pixar movies ever made...

Or am I just drawn to them because I love Lin-Manuel so much that I will irrationally support and be attracted to whatever he produces?

This question bothers me more than I'd like.
