Today at our house we enter Birthday Week: three of the five of our family members celebrate a birthday between now and next Tuesday. Today it's Addie entering her last pre-teen year. Tomorrow it's me leaving 40 behind. Next week KP starts her last year with a single digit age.

Man oh man, time flies.
