Books I've read over the past month or so:

**[_A Gentleman in Moscow_ by Amor Towles](http://amzn.to/2HNA6df)** An utterly charming novel about a Russian nobleman confined to hotel "house arrest" after the 1917 revolution. His adventures interacting with hotel staff (which he soon becomes) and guests are full of wit and grace and humor. I don't recall who recommended this one to me but I owe them my thanks.

**[_The People Are Going to Rise Like the Waters Upon Your Shore: A Story of American Rage_ by Jared Yates Sexton](http://amzn.to/2IDb2Xt)** A memoir from a liberal writer who covered the 2016 US presidential election. Heartfelt, but not as interesting or memorable as I had hoped it might be.

**[_House of Spies_ by Daniel Silva](http://amzn.to/2FVv8L3)** OK, the Gabriel Allon series is getting old. I probably should've figured that out seeing as this is book #17 in the series.

**[_1Q84_ by Haruki Murakami](http://amzn.to/2IAUgYU)** I first became acquainted with Murakami through his _Absolutely on Music_ book that I read a couple months ago. Having discovered he was a novelist I figured it was worth reading one. _1Q84_ was just interesting enough to keep me going through its 900 pages. I guess it's a love story at heart, albeit one with some odd and unexplained sci-fi twists.

**[_An Unkindness of Ghosts_ by Rivers Solomon](http://amzn.to/2HK1fh2)** A YA sci-fi novel with strong race / slavery / gender themes. Interesting in that it tried hard to represent a lot of racial and gender diversity. Managed to do it while only a little bit heavy-handed with the message.

**[_We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights_ by Adam Winkler](http://amzn.to/2FVx1Y9)** Heard about this one on an episode of NPR's _Fresh Air_. Fascinating (to me, a bit of a con law nerd) history of how American law has treated corporations with regard to rights and freedoms. Some cases, it seems, have had unintended consequences as the years went by; Ralph Nader's efforts to win corporate speech rights back in the 1970's seemed meant to benefit ordinary people by freeing up information that the government had restricted. Those same rights were used as the basis 30 years later for deciding in _Citizens United_ that corporations could dump unlimited money into political campaigns.

**[_Crimes of the Father_ by Thomas Keneally](http://amzn.to/2pnj6DK)** The author of the novel _Schindler's List_ takes on the Catholic church abuse scandal. Pleasant yet forgettable prose.

**[_Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention_ by Manning Marable](http://amzn.to/2HKsxDY)** Realized I didn't know much about Malcolm X, and this particular biography was recommended by Ta-Nehisi Coates somewhere. A very readable picture of a fascinating man.
