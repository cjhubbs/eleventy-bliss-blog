I've written before about [my Swedish Doppelganger](/14/03/my-swedish-doppelganger/) - the botanist Carl Skottsberg in his younger years, at least according to my sister-in-law. Yesterday I was alerted to another one.

Information on this alleged doppelganger comes to me from an older lady at church. She approached me yesterday to say that she watches the Jimmy Swaggart (eek!) TV program, gave me the DISH Network channel that she sees it on, and that Jimmy has a pianist who looks "just like" me and plays the piano "just as well" as I do.

I had to know more.

It turns out the pianist and band leader at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries is a guy named [Brian Haney](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIoEdmpoD60G2mluWUABoAcG8UunX-GZC). And, well... I see the resemblance.

If I had the time to dig up a few more pictures I'm sure I could find one of me at a piano that has eerie similarities to that one of Brian. I get that the white guy with the shaved head and beard is probably enough to trigger the churchgoing lady's awareness, but I think there's a little more than that.

I watched a few of Brian's YouTube videos and the dude is a talented musician. I might be able to match his Southern Gospel piano riffs, but he's got a voice that I sure don't.

He does seem to have a tendency for unfortunately-named songs, though... "I Found The Lily In My Valley" and "When God Dips His Pen Of Love In My Heart" make me realize CCM doesn't have an exclusive on unintended innuendo.

If you know of other doppelgangers of mine feel free to mention them... but really, the world probably has enough guys that look like me already. We don't need to overdo it.
