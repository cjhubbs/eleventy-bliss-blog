This little two-minute snippet of interview from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. summarizes an explanation of racist systems and a case for systemic reparations better than pretty much anything else I've heard. Worth considering.

> "Now I believe we ought to do all we can and seek to lift ourselves by our own bootstraps... but it's a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps. And many negroes, by the thousands and millions, have been left bootless as a result of all of these years of oppression..."

> Wow, I’ve seen/heard a lot of MLK footage but this is the first time I’ve seen this interview. How profound this is. [pic.twitter.com/Lm8SR2z3bT](https://t.co/Lm8SR2z3bT)
