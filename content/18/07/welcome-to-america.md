David Bentley Hart with a prophetic critique of America in a recent NYT column (HT to [Richard Beck](https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2018/07/welcome-to-united-states-of-america.html) for pointing it out):

> "America — with its decaying infrastructure, its third-world public transit, its shrinking labor market, its evaporating middle class, its expanding gulf between rich and poor, its heartless health insurance system, its mindless indifference to a dying ecology, its predatory credit agencies, its looming Social Security collapse, its interminable war, its metastasizing national debt and all the social pathologies that gave it a degenerate imbecile and child-abducting sadist as its president — remains the only developed economy in the world that believes it wrong to use civic wealth for civic goods. Its absurdly engorged military budget diverts hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the public weal to those who profit from the military-industrial complex. Its plutocratic policies and libertarian ethos are immune to all appeals of human solidarity. It towers over the world, but promises secure shelter only to the fortunate few." --David Bentley Hart, ["The New York Yankees Are a Moral Abomination"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/opinion/new-york-yankees-evil.html)
