Dr. Michael Horton has [a wise piece on CT](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/august-web-only/evangelicals-trump-elections-losing-everything.html?visit_source=twitter) in response to President Trump's comments to evangelical leaders that they are "one election away from losing everything".

> Nowhere in the New Testament are Christians called to avoid the responsibilities of our temporary citizenship, even though our ultimate citizenship is in heaven (Phil. 3:20). However, many of us sound like we’ve staked everything not only on constitutional freedoms but also on social respect, acceptance, and even power. But that comes at the cost of confusing the gospel with Christian nationalism. ... Anyone who believes, much less preaches, that evangelical Christians are “one election away from losing everything” in November has forgotten how to sing the psalmist’s warning, “Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save” (Ps. 146:3).

That'll preach.
