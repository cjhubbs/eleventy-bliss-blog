Really [good piece from Father Thomas McKenzie](http://www.thomasmckenzie.com/blog/living-as-a-christian-in-our-divided-nation) yesterday about living as a Christian in these divided American times. This bit is worth it alone:

> **Have your political opinions.** Seriously, you have the right to your opinions. You also have the right to voice them. Remember that other people have the same right. **Challenge your own opinion.** Where does your opinion match up with Scripture or the teachings of the Church. How does Jesus inform your opinion? Be humble enough to change your mind to match your faith. **Because someone has a different opinion, they are not your enemy.** They aren’t stupid, heartless, or evil. They are likely a normal person, a sinner, just like you. They may well be someone who loves Jesus, someone you’ll live with forever in Heaven. Treat them as you would like to be treated, remembering Jesus words to “love your neighbor as you love yourself,” and “do to others as you would have them do to you.”

His call for us to be Christians first, striving for healing and peace above all else, is a challenge to me. Worth reading the whole thing.
