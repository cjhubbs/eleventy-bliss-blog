From [a recent sermon](http://www.jonathanmartinwords.com/soapm/2018/10/31/anxious-for-nothing) on his Son of a Preacher Man podcast:

> The fake good news only sounds like good news to me and my tribe. The fake good news only sounds like good news if you go to my church. If they're in another village, it's bad news for them. But the real good news is not just good news for us, it's good news for them.

It's a sermon worth 40 minutes of your time.
