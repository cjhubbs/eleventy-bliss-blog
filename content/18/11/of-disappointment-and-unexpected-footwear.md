A week ago I ordered some foam replacement earbud covers from Amazon. Friday the package showed up. It did not contain foam replacement earbud covers. Instead, it contained this pair of handsome Spider-Man socks, even in my size!

After a brief consultation with Amazon customer service, my order was refunded and they're letting me keep the socks. Now I'm still waiting a few more days for another order of earbud covers, but on the whole, we'll call it a win.
