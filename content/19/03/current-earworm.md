I'm accompanying a local friend who's a high school senior when he sings for state contest in a couple weeks. I have now had this song he's singing stuck in my head since last Sunday night. "Vagabond", with text by Robert Louis Stevenson and music by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

There are worse earworms, I guess, but that little bum-padump-pa-dah signature is starting to wear on me...
