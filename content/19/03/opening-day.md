It's been a long winter. Heck, it's been a long _week_. Which makes today a particularly happy one: it's opening day for Major League Baseball. (OK, the Mariners and A's played two games in Japan a week ago that were officially regular season games, but today is the _real_ opening day.)

I've enjoyed baseball since I was a kid, having spent many hours as a teenager listening to the Texas Rangers on the radio. Upon moving to Iowa after college I fell in with a bunch of Chicago Cubs fans and have followed them ever since. We took the kids to Wrigley Field last fall for the first time, and I have some kid-made Cubs fan art hanging in my office that dates back to Game 7 of the 2016 World Series. I won't be free to sit and watch the Opening Day game with them today - darn workday afternoon games! - but I'm doing my best to pass a love of the game on to the next generation.

Play ball! Oh, and: Go Cubs, Go!
