One of my favorite discoveries as of late has been the new webcomic [Strange Planet](https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/?hl=en). Apparently only published via Instagram, artist Nathan W. Pyle explores mundane human activities through the lens of aliens. It's delightful and odd. A characteristic example:

I don't know how long Mr. Pyle can sustain this pace and level of observation, but I'm definitely gonna enjoy these as long as they keep coming.
