Maybe I'll start posting these every time again... but for now I've got a long-ish list of books I've finished already this year. Particular standouts are in **bold**. Here goes nothin':

_[All That's Good: Recovering the Lost Art of Discernment](https://amzn.to/2Dzt3oy)_ [](https://amzn.to/2Dzt3oy) by Hannah Anderson  
_[Fruit of the Drunken Tree](https://amzn.to/2DAGlkT)_ [](https://amzn.to/2DAGlkT) by Ingrid Rojas Contreras  
_[Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World](https://amzn.to/2GHuF1J)_ [](https://amzn.to/2GHuF1J) by Nicholas Ostler

_**[The Color of Compromise: The Truth About the American Church's Complicity in Racism](https://amzn.to/2IYhMC2)**_ **[](https://amzn.to/2IYhMC2) by Jemar Tisby**Tisby carefully and methodically lays out the complicity and often encouragement that the American church gave to personal and institutional racism. A painful but needed reminder that we have a long way to go and a lot to make right.  
  
_[The Killer Collective](https://amzn.to/2XHrlJF)_ by Barry Eisler  
_[Becoming the Gospel: Paul, Participation, and Mission](https://amzn.to/2DAIf53)_ by Michael J. Gorman  
_[Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years](https://amzn.to/2GHuR0X)_ by Diarmaid MacCulloch  
_[The Feral Detective](https://amzn.to/2XNtALv)_ by Jonathan Lethem  
  
_**[We Need Each Other: Responding to God's Call to Live Together](https://amzn.to/2Vq2M6u)**_ **by Jean Vanier**[Vanier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Vanier) is a Catholic humanitarian who founded a federation of communities dedicated to caring for people with developmental disabilities. I've heard and watched a couple interviews with Vanier and his holiness and humility are immediately evident in a way that's incredibly rare. ([His On Being interview with Krista Tippett](https://onbeing.org/programs/jean-vanier-the-wisdom-of-tenderness/) is a great one.)His book is similarly humble and holy.  
  
_[Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life](https://amzn.to/2Vsxagu)_ by Adam Greenfield  
  
_**[My Traitor's Heart: A South African Exile Returns to Face His Country, His Tribe, and His Conscience](https://amzn.to/2IVvbut)**_ **by Rian Malan**Written prior to the end of apartheid in South Africa, Malan, a white South African journalist, tries to come to grips with the system of white supremacy that to him seems both wicked and unchangeable.  
  
_[Rogue Lawyer](https://amzn.to/2GGDrx0)_ by John Grisham  
_[The Text of the Old Testament: An Introduction to the Biblical Hebraica](https://amzn.to/2DB94WE)_ by Ernst Wurthwein  
_[Reconstructing the Gospel: Finding Freedom from Slaveholder Religion](https://amzn.to/2XGhjZa)_ by Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove  
  
_**[Benefit of the Doubt: Breaking the Idol of Certainty](https://amzn.to/2IXnYtV)**_ **[](https://amzn.to/2IXnYtV) by Gregory A. Boyd**Boyd makes the case that doubt can enhance faith, and that at times the need for certainty can be more damaging than helpful. I'm right there with him on that one.  
  
_[Paul: A Biography](https://amzn.to/2DtWHvF)_ by N. T. Wright  
_[A Prayer for Owen Meany](https://amzn.to/2VspTNN)_ by John Irving  
  
_**[Hyperion](https://amzn.to/2ITob14)**_ **by Dan Simmons**Award-winning science fiction. Imaginative in a way that only the best sci-fi is.  
  
_[Zoo Nebraska: The Dismantling of an American Dream](https://amzn.to/2Dzu3ci)_ by Carson Vaughan

![](/images/2019/all-the-good-music.jpeg)

  
_**[Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?: Larry Norman and the Perils of Christian Rock](https://amzn.to/2IWr80R)**_ **by Gregory Alan Thornbury**A well-written and -researched biography of one of the truly fascinating characters of early contemporary Christian music.  
  
_[All You Can Ever Know: A Memoir](https://amzn.to/2Dzx38R)_ by Nicole Chung  
  
_**[Flee, Be Silent, Pray: An Anxious Evangelical Finds Peace with God through Contemplative Prayer](https://amzn.to/2GJol9V)**_ **by Ed Cyzewski**  
Cyzewski makes the case for contemplative prayer being not just helpful but necessary, and makes it sound easy enough that even this long-time evangelical feels like I should take up the practice.

At the moment I've got another long one going: Rebecca West's _[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon](https://amzn.to/2XHrMnh)_. (1200 pages!)
