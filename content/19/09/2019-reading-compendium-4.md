Goodness, I've let this go a while without providing a list. Here we go...

_**[Anointed with Oil: How Christianity and Crude Made Modern America](https://amzn.to/2O9aRIL)**_ **by Darren Dochuk**  
A fascinating look at how the oil industry worked hand in hand with evangelical Christianity to shape America in the 20th century. Read [Heath W. Carter's 5-star review](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/june-web-only/anointed-oil-darren-dochuk-christianity-crude-america.html) over at _Christianity Today_.

_**[The Rule of Law](https://amzn.to/2LEgQ6M)**_ **by John Lescroart**  
Meh. This series has gone on far too long at this point.

_**[My Antonia](https://amzn.to/30aT5Md)**_ **by Willa Cather**  
Easily my favorite of Cather's Prairie Trilogy.

**_[The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt: The History of a Civilization from 3000 BC to Cleopatra](https://amzn.to/2Qktps9)_ by Toby Wilkinson**  
The book wasn't quite as long as the empire. Still trying to get my head around a legitimate empire that spanned millennia. Astounding.

**_[Palace Walk](https://amzn.to/30tmDA4)_ by Naguib Mahfouz**  
I remember almost nothing about this book.

**_[On The Neurobiology of Sin](https://amzn.to/2Oariof)_ by Lazar Puhalo**  
A short treatise by an Orthodox bishop addressing, among other things, homosexuality and transgenderism. Reads like an undergraduate-level paper on genetics combined with a couple weak blog posts on theology. I was disappointed.

**_[The Inner Kingdom](https://amzn.to/2LDYEdx)_ by Kallistos Ware**  
A collection of essays from an Eastern Orthodox bishop.

**_[God Land: A Story of Faith, Loss, and Renewal in Middle America](https://amzn.to/308IIsA)_ by Lyz Lenz**  
I have a complicated relationship with this book, but I think it has some good insights about the church in the Midwest.

**_[Last Day](https://amzn.to/30r1Tcd)_ by Domenica Ruta**  
An interesting concept for a novel that never really came together.

**_[Laurus](https://amzn.to/30vm8Fy)_ by Eugene Vodolazkin**  
Now _this_ one was well worth reading. A beautiful novel about a medieval Russian "holy fool". Rod Dreher has [a nice piece about it](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-wonder-working-laurus/) if you want to read more.

**_[Normal People](https://amzn.to/2LG9X4Z)_ by Sally Rooney**  
Maybe normal people are boring. Or at least this book was.

**_[Reading Romans Backwards: A Gospel of Peace in the Midst of Empire](https://amzn.to/2LCfI3g)_ by Scot McKnight**  
Start at the end of Romans, Dr. McKnight says, understand the context and audience, and then work your way back to get a better perspective on what the doctrinal passages mean. Interesting.

**_[The Bird King](https://amzn.to/2Qtg1BU)_ by G. Willow Wilson**  
Picked up at random off the library shelf. A fantasy novel from a Middle Eastern Muslim perspective. Enjoyed it, though didn't feel like the last third held up to the promise of the first two-thirds.

**_[The Christian Imagination: Theology and the Origins of Race](https://amzn.to/2M6Nvka)_ by Willie James Jennings**  
Oh man, this one was thick. A hard read but some good insight.

**_[Alif the Unseen](https://amzn.to/306MfYi)_ by G. Willow Wilson**  
The _other_ book I read by Wilson the past couple months. Sort of a cyberpunk fantasy novel set in the Arab Spring in Egypt. Dug it.

**_[The Orthodox Church: An Introduction to Eastern Christianity](https://amzn.to/2O9xQmV)_ by Kallistos Ware**  
A historical and doctrinal primer by one of the esteemed bishops of the Orthodox Church.

**_[Stokely: A Life](https://amzn.to/30c92Sz)_ by Peniel E. Joseph**  
A biography of Stokely Carmichael, the founder of the Black Panther Party. Knew nothing about him before reading the book. Quite a charismatic guy.

**_[What Is a Girl Worth?: My Story of Breaking the Silence and Exposing the Truth about Larry Nassar and USA Gymnastics](https://amzn.to/2OcfRwa)_ by Rachael Denhollander**  
I knew this woman was a hero for publicly coming forward with allegations of sexual abuse against Nasser. What I didn't realize before reading the memoir was how integral she was in every part of building and executing the case against him. So much to love about this book and its heroes, Rachael and her faithful husband Jacob.

**_[Dignity: Seeking Respect in Back Row America](https://amzn.to/308Jc0U)_ by Chris Arnade**  
This one really merits its own post. Arnade traveled the country exploring "back row America" and its people. Gripping personal narratives and photography.
