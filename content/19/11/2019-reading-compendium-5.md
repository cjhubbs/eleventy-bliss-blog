**[_A High View of Scripture? The Authority of the Bible and the Formation of the New Testament Canon_ by Craig D. Allert](https://amzn.to/2D3tR4p)**  
See my [prior review here](https://chrishubbs.com/2019/09/21/a-high-view-of-scripture/).

[**_A Short History of Nearly Everything_** **by Bill Bryson**](https://amzn.to/2r3exlU)  
A quick engaging read. But honestly, Bryson's prose is _so_ breezy and clever that I'm inclined to distrust it.

**[_Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret Wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan_ by Steve Coll](https://amzn.to/37gZrd0)**  
A knowledgeable, detailed overview of the CIA's involvement in those regions over the past decade. Interesting stuff. Also annoying that the author and his editor apparently believed it to be necessary to include the periods in abbreviating _Central Intelligence Agency_ as "C. I. A." every single time it appeared in the book. Every. Single. Time.

**[_Wanderers_ by Chuck Wendig](https://amzn.to/2r6EW22)**  
Equal parts Stephen King and Michael Crichton. Really entertaining dystopian sci-fi/horror.

**[_In the Shelter: Finding a Home in the World_ by Pádraig Ó Tuama](https://amzn.to/2rUjNIJ)**  
Oh man, this one was good. Ó Tuama is an Irish poet and student of the New Testament with remarkable compassion and insight.

**[_The Tech-Wise Family: Everyday Steps for Putting Technology in Its Proper Place_ by Andy Crouch](https://amzn.to/2r63VT9)**  
Not bad, but not as groundbreaking as all my Twitter folks made it out to be. Practical advice, though.

**[_Man's Search for Meaning_ by Viktor E. Frankl](https://amzn.to/2O1iO27)**  
A classic memoir and philosophical text by a Holocaust survivor.

**[_Flunking Sainthood: A Year of Breaking the Sabbath, Forgetting to Pray, and Still Loving My Neighbor_ by Jana Riess](https://amzn.to/2O4jfJf)**  
Rachel Held Evans (RIP \*sniff\*) did it better.

**[_Noughts & Crosses_ by Malorie Blackman](https://amzn.to/2r6474P)**  
Dystopian YA where the twist is that blacks are the race in power and whites are just gaining their freedom. Not as much done with that twist as there should've been if that's the key conceit of the novel, but it wasn't bad.

**[_The Kremlin Strike_ by Dale Brown](https://amzn.to/344eAfU)**  
Sometimes you just gotta go for mindless entertainment.

**[_The Overstory_ by Richard Powers](https://amzn.to/2XqwE1d)**  
Mindless entertainment this one was not. A curiously-crafted novel with short stories that provide background for the main characters who drive the second half of the novel. All about trees. Yes, trees. Oh, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was shortlisted for the Man Booker.

**[_American Spy_ by Lauren Wilkinson](https://amzn.to/2O1LcBe)**  
A spy story written from the perspective of a female spy in the 1980s. Strong start, wanders and gets boring in the back half.

**[_Pachinko_ by Min Jin Lee](https://amzn.to/2rYPW21)**  
An epic generational tale starting in 1920s Japan and Korea. Very enjoyable storytelling.

**[_Scythe_ by Neal Shusterman](https://amzn.to/37gecN7)**  
This was a really fun YA novel. In the near future, human suffering and death has been eliminated. To avoid population overgrowth, a special group of people are chosen as "scythes", tasked with killing a certain number of people every year. Moral dilemmas ensue. I want to read the next book in the series!

**[_The Fifth Column_ by Andrew Gross](https://amzn.to/2QIxBkf)**  
Fairly basic adventure novel set in 1940's New York focused on German spies living in the USA. Quick, light read.

**[_Letters to a Young Catholic_ by George Weigel](https://amzn.to/2OqpB4j)**  
I'm not Catholic, and I'm not that young. But Wiegel's collection of "letters" on various topics of interest to the Catholic church were an interesting perspective for a Protestant like me.
