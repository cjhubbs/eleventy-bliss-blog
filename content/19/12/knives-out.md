Took the family to see Rian Johnson’s latest film, _Knives Out_, this afternoon. I know Johnson is a big-name filmmaker at this point - writing and directing an episode of the _Star Wars_ franchise will do that for you. But I still feel like I knew him back when, thanks to the guys on the _Filmspotting_ podcast championing his work from the very beginning. Having watched _Brick_, _The Brothers Bloom_, and _Looper_, I had a good feeling about _The Last Jedi_, and when _Knives Out_ was announced, I was ready to buy tickets immediately.

_Knives Out_ is Johnson’s take on the whodunnit genre, _a la_ Agatha Christie. That means to avoid spoilers I shouldn’t really say anything more about it. But I have a few non-spoilery thoughts.

First: Rian Johnson is a master of taking genre movies bending the genre ever so slightly for a knowing audience. He did it with _film noir_ in Brick, and with time travel movies in _Looper_. Suffice to say he does it again masterfully here in _Knives Out_.

Second: That closing shot is the best I’ve seen in years. It’s just perfect.

Finally: now knowing how it ends, I really want to go watch it again to see how much it telegraphed early on that I completely missed. Johnson is careful enough that I doubt there are many (any) loose ends.
