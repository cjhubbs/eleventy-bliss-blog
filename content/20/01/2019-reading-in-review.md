The beginning of a new year means a quick look back first at last year’s reading in review. (Some people put these lists out at the end of the year... I’m still adding books to the list until the very end, so New Year’s Day it is!) I’ve posted a few compendiums (compendia?) through the year and highlighted some favorites as I went, so I’ll just do a brief wrap-up here.

My 2019 reading is all [logged over on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?order=a&shelf=2019-reads&sort=date_read) (as is everything I’ve read since 2007!). Somehow I got through 82 books in 2019 - the most I’ve ever read in a year. 33 of those were fiction... which left a lot of non-fiction, mostly theology and history. I read 23 by female authors this year, which is more than previous years, though not quite as many as I had hoped to get to.

Favorite fiction of the year:

- _Virgil Wander_ by Leif Enger
- _Pachinko_ by Min Jin Lee
- _Wanderers_ by Chuck Wendig
- _Laurus_ by Eugene Vodolazkin

Favorite non-fiction of the year:

- _A Song for Nagasaki_ by Paul Glynn
- _In The Shelter: Finding a Home in the World_ by Padraig O Tuama
- _Dignity: Seeking Respect in Back Row America_ by Chris Arnade
- _What Is A Girl Worth?_ by Rachael Denhollander
- _God in the Rainforest: A Tale of Martyrdom and Redemption in Amazonian Ecuador_ by Kathryn T. Long
- _Paul and Gender: Reclaiming the Apostle’s Vision for Men and Women in Christ_ by Cynthia Long Westfall 
- _Hannah’s Child: A Theologian’s Memoir_ by Stanley Hauerwas

For 2020 I’d really like to find a little more fiction that engages me. I’ve picked up several novels this year only to have them completely fail to capture my interest enough to go on with them. I have a plenty big pile of unread books next to my bed and on my Kindle to work through.

Alternately, I could probably spend the whole year just reading Charles Taylor’s _A Secular Age_ and David Foster Wallace’s _Infinite Jest_... and chase it with something really long from N. T. Wright. 

Here’s to another year of reading!
