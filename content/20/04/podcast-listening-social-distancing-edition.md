Back in the old days (say, before March 2020), my podcast listening tilted heavily toward current events. For my own mental well-being, that isn’t a good listening diet whilst being at home for weeks on end. So, in addition to my usual handful of sermon podcasts, what’s a guy to listen to? How about stories about people far worse off than ourselves?

Enter the _[Fall of Civilizations Podcast](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/)_. Hosted by [Paul M. M. Cooper](https://www.paulmmcooper.com/), this podcast takes lengthy (90 minutes to 3 hours) looks at ancient civilizations, what drove them to flourish, and then what caused their downfall. Cooper is a British writer and archivist with a PhD focused on the cultural and literary significance of ruins. His podcast isn’t particularly fancy from a production standpoint - mostly him narrating, occasional voice actors reading historical documents, and some background music - but he delves into the history of great civilizations and brings them to life.

Over the last couple weeks I’ve listened with fascination as Cooper described the fall of [the Roman Empire in Britain](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/2019/01/21/episode-one-of-fall-of-civilizations-is-now-live/), the [Mediterranean Bronze Age](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/2019/01/21/episode-2-is-now-live/), and [the Khmer Empire of medieval Cambodia](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/2019/05/06/episode-5-of-fall-of-civilizations-is-now-live/). (I didn’t get _that_ one in college history class!) There are only ten episodes in total right now, so I only have another 8 or 10 hours of listening left ahead of me, but it’s been quite enjoyable.

If you’ve got an interest in ancient history or in hours of narration by a guy with a nice British accent, it’s worth a try. You can find it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT6Y5JJPKe_JDMivpKgVXew), SoundCloud, or generally wherever you listen to podcasts.
