Culling my list down to 10 albums was a challenge. Here are a few also-rans that just didn't quite make the cut:

**_The Morning_ - Andrew Osenga**  
This one got a _lot_ of play time from me, and I spent a lot of time playing its songs. Andy O's solo stuff continues to be meaningful to me, but this one hit the sweet spot where our life experiences aligned and I felt like he was writing about the things that I'd write about if only I had any skill at writing songs.

**_In Rainbows_ - Radiohead**  
Radiohead is another band I came to mid-stream. _In Rainbows_ is not usually listed as anybody's favorite Radiohead album, but it was the gateway for me into their music. I dig it.

**_All That You Can't Leave Behind_ - U2**  
Same story - this was the gateway for me into U2's music. Such a good record.

**_Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Soundtrack_ - Lin-Manuel Miranda and cast**  
All that stuff I said about my love for smart wordplay? _Hamilton_ has that in spades. More than any other record I can think of. My love for _Hamilton_ knows no bounds.
