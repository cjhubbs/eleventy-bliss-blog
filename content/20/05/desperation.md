How desperate am I for live sports?

I’m watching NASCAR. And hard pressed to turn it off when they went into a rain delay.

As Groucho Marx toasted the stuffy society lady in _Animal Crackers_:

> “A toast: to your charm, your beauty, and your brains. Which should give you a general idea of how hard up I am for a drink.”

_Note: I’m like 99% sure that toast came from_ Animal Crackers_, but the internet isn’t helpful in finding it. So here’s another classic clip from that movie._
