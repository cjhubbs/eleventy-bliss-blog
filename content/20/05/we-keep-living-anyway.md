The chorus of this tune has resonated in my head a lot this week.

Theodosia writes me a letter every day  
I'm keeping her bed warm while her husband is away  
He's on the British side in Georgia  
He's trying to keep the colonies in line  
But he can keep all of Georgia  
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate  
Between the sinners  
And the saints  
It takes and it takes and it takes  
And we keep loving anyway  
We laugh and we cry  
And we break  
And we make our mistakes  
And if there's a reason I'm by her side  
When so many have tried  
Then I'm willing to wait for it  
I'm willing to wait for it

My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher  
But there are things that the  
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya  
My mother was a genius  
My father commanded respect  
When they died they left no instructions  
Just a legacy to protect

Death doesn't discriminate  
Between the sinners and the saints  
It takes and it takes and it takes  
And we keep living anyway  
We rise and we fall  
And we break  
And we make our mistakes  
And if there's a reason I'm still alive  
When everyone who loves me has died  
I'm willing to wait for it  
I'm willing to wait for it

I am the one thing in life I can control  
I am inimitable  
I am an original  
I'm not falling behind or running late  
I'm not standing still  
I am lying in wait  
  
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb  
He has something to prove  
He has nothing to lose  
Hamilton's pace is relentless  
He wastes no time  
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate  
He exhibits no restraint  
He takes and he takes and he takes  
And he keeps winning anyway  
He changes the game  
He plays and he raises the stakes  
And if there's a reason  
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit

I'm willing to wait for it  
I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate  
Between the sinners and the saints  
It takes and it takes and it takes  
And we keep living anyway  
We rise and we fall and we break  
And we make our mistakes  
And if there's a reason I'm still alive  
When so many have died  
Then I'm willin' to_..._
