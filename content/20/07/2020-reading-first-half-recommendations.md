July 1st means that we're halfway through 2020 already... what a year. I looked back and realized I haven't posted any reading compendiums yet this year. And to be honest, the reading has been a little slow. You'd think a work-from-home pandemic would mean more time for reading, but in reality it's turned out to leave fewer brain cycles for processing books. But I _have_ done some reading. Rather than list everything I've read (which [you can see on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?shelf=2020-reads) if you really want to), I'll just list some highlights.

[**_This is How You Lose the Time War_** by Amal El-Mohtar](https://amzn.to/2BUGYb6)  
An inventive short sci-fi novel from the voices of two competing people engaged in some sort of, well, time war. Hard to describe, but it was short and easy to read and I enjoyed it.

[**_The Education of an Idealist: A Memoir_** by Samantha Power](https://amzn.to/2ZG2hWb)  
I loved this book so much. Power is a fascinating woman. Born in Ireland, came to America as a child, became a journalist and human rights advocate more or less on her own in her 20s, latched on to the Obama campaign in 2008 as an adviser on human rights issues and ended up serving as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. Really well written and engaging read. If Joe Biden gets elected this fall, Power seems like a great candidate to be Secretary of State in his administration.

[**_With Head and Heart: The Autobiography of Howard Thurman_** by Howard Thurman](https://amzn.to/3dPVzSf)  
A fascinating memoir of a black man from the South who ended up as a progressive pastor in San Francisco.

[**_Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World_** by Tom Holland](https://amzn.to/2BhZ0Eh)  
Holland makes the case that Christianity has remade the world over the past two millennia - that most of what we consider western human values today - care for human rights, the dignity of all people, regard for the poor, etc - were not considered virtues before Christianity.

I've got several books in progress at the moment which should provide some more good recommendations... I'll keep you all posted.
