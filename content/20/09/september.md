Suffice it to say I’m happy to have August 2020 in the rear view mirror.

We have completed our house repairs after the derecho. Having a brother in construction sure makes that easier! Repaired the cracked rafter, rebuilt the broken dormer, reshingled the roof... Tree guy is working this week to take down the trees that won’t survive (which is most of them).

School in Cedar Rapids is starting three weeks late due to all the storm damage, and will then be 100% virtual rather than 50/50 in person. This change has probably been harder on the kids than the storm was. They are _so_ ready to have a routine again and see people.

Wonder where we’ll be when October 1 gets here? In 2020 every month feels like a year. I wonder how long that’ll last.
