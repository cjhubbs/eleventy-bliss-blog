I don't remember who shared this on Twitter the other day, but I listened to it once and it's been stuck in my head ever since. [Joey Weisenberg](https://joeyweisenberg.bandcamp.com/music) leads this Jewish musical group singing a song inspired by Psalm 137. It's sort of like if The Lone Bellow started writing music for your local synagogue. So dang good.

He's got [a bunch of albums up on Bandcamp](https://joeyweisenberg.bandcamp.com/music), but it appears that this might be the only song in English of the whole bunch. My lack of knowing Hebrew isn't stopping me from enjoying the rest of his music, though.
