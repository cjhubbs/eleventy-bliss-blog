I’m feeling particularly crusty today. In the spirit of efficiency, I expect I can write a bunch of bullets here such that everyone can find something that they disagree with.

### On politics:

- Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to subvert our legitimate election results are traitorous, and the Republican politicians unwilling to call him out on it are spineless opportunists who aren’t worthy to be described as leaders.
- The Democratic Party's insistence on making “any abortion, any time” table stakes for being a Democratic candidate is holding the party back from majority rule for the next 50 years.
- The Trump administration’s failure to govern with any priorities other than “what’s best for Trump” makes it the worst presidential administration in the history of the Republic.
- If the Democrats want to claim any sort of moral high ground, they’re going to have to get their own house in order. It’s time to stop trotting out Bill Clinton, even if he is a southern Democrat who gives a good speech.

### On the evangelical church:

- I won't claim to be an evangelical any more, but I'm clearly still working through a bunch of stuff.
- The evangelical church’s focus on patriarchy (dressed up as “complementary gender roles”) has deprived the church of more than half its voice.
- The church’s continued trouble with tolerating and covering up sexual abuse would be significantly lessened if women were afforded the same church leadership roles as men.
- The huge emphasis on the LGBTQ discussion within the evangelical church is the result of fundamentalist leaders desperately clinging to the same magisterial authority of Scripture interpretation that the Reformation protested against 500 years ago. Once the commoners realize the Holy Spirit enables them to understand the Scripture on their own and they're not automatically going to hell if they disagree with the church's teaching, the power is broken.
- 8 months of not attending worship services (thanks, pandemic) has made it clear how important being able to attend worship services is.

### On moral issues:

- Most "pro-life" people don't really, at a core level, believe that an early-term abortion is the same, morally, as killing an infant after birth. If they really did, they would take stronger action.
- Nobody _wants_ to get a late-term abortion. The ones that tragically may be needed are worked out in painful circumstances that won't benefit from laws that would force jumping through a lot of hoops.
- Everyone should want the number of abortions to go down. This would happen with better access to contraceptives, better sex education, and better support for pregnant women and young parents.
- LGBTQ people deserve the same rights, protections, and affirmations as anyone else. Including in the church. Yes, I've read all the verses and heard all the arguments. But I've met LGBTQ brothers and sisters who clearly love Jesus and have the Holy Spirit working in their lives. And then I go to Peter's words in Acts 11 after preaching to <gasp> the Gentiles.

> As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit'. If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?
> <br/>  
> Acts 11:15-17, NRSV

The arguments can be complicated. As Robert Capon says in _Between Noon and Three_, if God is a bastard, we're all in trouble. So in the end, I'm going to rely on the hope that God is loving and gracious and he can sort it out.

Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me.
