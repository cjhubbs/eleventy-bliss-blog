Another year, another review of my annual reading. The mess that was 2020 definitely affected my reading - there were a couple months in there where I simply didn’t have the mental energy for anything challenging. Nevertheless, I completed 60+ books, [logged as usual over on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=2020-reads).

Last year in my roundup I said I should try to read some more engaging fiction in 2020. I wasn’t very successful there - only 23 novels (out of 64 books) this year. I did read a few very good ones, though, so I guess that’s something. I only read 13 female authors all year... I could get more rounded there.

### Fiction

Some of my favorite fiction of the year:

- _Sing, Unburied, Sing_ by Jemsyn Ward
- _A Children’s Bible_ by Lydia Millet
- _Children of Time_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky

### Non-Fiction

- _Caste: The Origin of our Discontents_ by Isabel Wilkerson
- _Jesus and John Wayne_ by Kristen Kobes Du Mez
- _The Education of an Idealist_ by Samantha Power
- _The Body Keeps the Score_ by Bessel van der Horst

It’s not lost on me as I list these out that many of my favorites of the year were written by women. That could be a clue to me that a well-rounded reading list will also be an engaging reading list.

### Really Long Books

It’s entirely possible my book count would’ve gone up if I’d not read some _really long_ books... but then I would’ve also missed some really good books. Notable really long books this year:

- _A Secular Age_ by Charles Taylor (896 pages)
- _Black Lamb and Grey Falcon_ by Rebecca West (1181 pages)
- _The New Testament in its World_ by. N. T. Wright and Michael F. Bird (992 pages)
- _Crucifixion of the Warrior God_ by Gregory Boyd (1492 pages)
- _Dominion_ by Tom Holland (a paltry 624 pages)

Maybe my goal for 2021 should be some shorter books...
