One of my favorite 2020 discoveries (which, ok, only came out in 2020, so I was on it from the beginning) is the _[Young Adult Movie Ministry Podcast](https://yammpod.substack.com/)_. A production of Sam Thielman and Alissa Wilkinson, two journalists and movie critics, YAMMPOD approaches movies from a sort of post-evangelical perspective. In Episode 1 of the podcast, Alissa notes that she was homeschooled through her youth, and then says that when asked about being homeschooled, her usual response is that she was _very_ homeschooled. I resemble that remark.

The podcast moves quickly and is rife with references to other movies, books, and other cultural artifacts. The podcast show notes are perfunctory but not particularly detailed. Hmmmm, I thought, I know how to fill _that_ gap.

Enter [YAMMPOD.info](https://yammpod.info), where I'm creating a post per episode to itemize all the movies and references that the hosts and guests drop. 28 episodes in, this is kinda fun.

If I were to recommend one particularly meaningful episode, I'd go to [Episode 21, "Bread Alone"](https://yammpod.info/episode-21/), with guest Jeffrey Overstreet discussing _Babette's Feast_. Other standouts are [Episode 6, "Sullied by Monotheism"](https://yammpod.info/episode-6/), with the hilarious Lyz Lenz discussing _The Story of Ruth_ and [Episode 12, "Noir 101"](https://yammpod.info/episode-12/), with guest Jamelle Bouie addressing not just _The Maltese Falcon_ but the whole _noir_ genre.
