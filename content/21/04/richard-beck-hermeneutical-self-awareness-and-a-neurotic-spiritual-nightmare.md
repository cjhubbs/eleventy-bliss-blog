Richard Beck is on a roll this week with a short series on reading the Bible. In [Part #1](https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/04/reading-bible-part-1-make-your-call.html) yesterday he states premise #1: "Interpreting is inescapable."

> Do the hard work of Biblical study, put in the time and effort to explore, but don't think you can avoid, in the final analysis, the necessity of making a call. So make it. 

Today in [Part #2](https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/04/reading-bible-part-2-god-has-your-back.html) he highlights the terror that can come when the self-awareness of interpretation is paired with a belief that God will judge you if you get it wrong.

> Hermeneutical Self-Awareness + Judgmental God = A Whole Lot of Anxiety

I don't know that I ever verbalized this thought myself, but I think it drove a lot of my study and reading in my 20s and 30s. Here's how Beck describes it:

> Biblical interpretation is so anxiety-inducing because it's viewed as so high stakes. Your eternal destiny hangs in the balance, so you have to get it right. And yet, given the hermeneutical situation, you lack any firm guarantees you've made the right choice. The whole thing is a neurotic spiritual nightmare. In fact, it's this nightmare that keeps many Christians from stepping into self-awareness to own and admit their own hermeneutics. It's more comforting to remain oblivious and un-self-aware. 

This put me in mind of [a piece I wrote a few years ago](/18/05/albert-mohler-the-sbc-and-metoo/) where, as an aside, I mentioned that I'm certainly wrong about some percentage of beliefs, but I can't tell you which ones. Turns out I was interacting with a Richard Beck piece in that one, too. So what do you do? How do you get your way out of Beck's "neurotic spiritual nightmare"?

By reevaluating one of the terms in the equation.

> So I told my students, You have to believe that God's got your back, that, yes, you might make a mistake. But that mistake isn't determinative or damning. Just be faithful and humble. You don't have to have all the correct answers to be loved by your Father. Each of us will carry into heaven a raft of confusions, errors, and misinterpretations of Scripture. It's unavoidable. We will not score 100% on the final exam. 
> <br/>  
> But don't worry. Let your heart be at rest. God's got your back.

As I like to paraphrase something Robert F. Capon said in _[Between Noon and Three](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9780802842220)_: yes, I'm assuming that God is at heart loving and gracious. Because, let's face it: if God is a bastard, we're all screwed.
