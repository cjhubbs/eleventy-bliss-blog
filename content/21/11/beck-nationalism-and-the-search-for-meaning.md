Richard Beck, [on his Substack today](https://richardbeck.substack.com/p/deep-meaning-self-esteem-and-nationalism), on American nationalism resulting from the need for deep meaning:

> ...for most of human history, we achieved deep meaning by a connection with an ancestral people. Our tribe, kin, and clan. These relations gave us a history and roots.
> <br/>  
> But with the rise of the modern nation state, especially with such a rootless nation of immigrants like America, our identities have become increasingly associated less with a tribe than a state, a flag, a country. I am who I am--I matter, I have worth--because I'm an _American_.

It's an easy observation that American nationalism is characterized by pride in the country, but Beck's piece pushed me to think more about how Americans, and especially _Christian_ Americans, could be helped away from the more vitriolic forms of nationalism by finding more meaning in other parts of their self-identityâ€”perhaps specifically in their Christian faith.

Beck, again:

> _Without deep meaning Americans achieve self-esteem via the status of the nation._ You elevate the stature of the nation and you elevate the worth, value, and dignity of its citizens. Make America great and you make its people great. There is a primal pull here, rooted deep in the limbic system. It's not abstract, but a raw, visceral ground of dignity.

How can I encourage other Christians to find more deep meaning and identity in their faith instead of (or even more than) their country?
