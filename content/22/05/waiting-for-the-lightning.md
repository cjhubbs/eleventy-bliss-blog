For a guy who loves music, I’ve never been the guy who finds and falls in love with an artist on their first album. From my youth I have tended to find bands on their second or third album - probably the popular one - then gone back and learned their back catalog.

In high school, this meant getting to know Michael W. Smith through _Go West Young Man_ and then backing up to appreciate _i2EYE_; falling in love with Rich Mullins’ _Liturgy, Legacy_ record and then going back to _Never Picture Perfect_, and bypassing my brother’s recommendation of Caedmon’s Call until their producer insisted on some highly uncharacteristic horns on the title track of _Long Line of Leavers_ that sucked me in. (_Self Titled_ or _40 Acres_? I still can’t decide which is their best record.)

As an adult I wasn’t into Coldplay until _X&Y_ and then belatedly recognized the brilliance of _Parachutes_ and _Rush of Blood to the Head_. I met U2 via _All That You Can’t Leave Behind_ and still probably don’t sufficiently appreciate _Achtung Baby_ and _The Joshua Tree_. And then there’s Arcade Fire.

I’m sure I’d heard of Arcade Fire from friends at some point early on. _Neon Bible_ had a lot of buzz in my Twitter follows. Somehow it just never caught my ear. But then _The Suburbs_ came out in late 2010, somewhere in the winter I picked it up on an AmazonMP3 $3.99 sale (remember those days?), and in spring 2011 when I trained for a half-marathon, it was my running music. (Somehow my initial download from Amazon missed the first two tracks, so for a long time I thought the album started with “Modern Man”. Not sure when I realized I was missing songs.)

The albums we really fall in love with are the ones we identify with somehow. When Rich Mullins sang “my folks we were always / the first family to arrive / with seven people jammed into / a car that seated five”, my heart ached in recognition of our own 7-member family adventures in undersized, well used cars. When Andrew Osenga sang “my tiny baby’s breathing / deeper every day / soon she’ll leave her crib forever”, I resonated with the heart of a kindred new father. And when Win Butler lamented “oh, this city’s seen so much / since I was a little child / Pray to God I won’t live to see / the death of everything that’s wild”, mid-30s suburban dad me felt it in my core. _The Suburbs_ burrowed its way into my heart like few albums ever have.

Arcade Fire’s fire burns hot. Band leader Win Butler grew up in Houston. His wife, Régine Chassagne, is from Montreal but has roots in Haiti. He grew up Mormon and majored in religious studies at McGill. They aren’t a “Christian band” and say they don’t really practice religion, but their songs give voice to the Gen X disillusionment with and deconstruction of establishment Christianity that many of us have experienced. In “Here Comes the Night Time”, using the voice of Haitians to reject the legalistic strictures of white Christianity:

> They say heaven's a place  
> Yeah, heaven's a place, and they know where it is  
> But you know where it is?  
> It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
> <br/>  
> And when they hear the beat coming from the street  
> They lock the door  
> But if there's no music up in heaven,  
> Then what's it for?
> <br/>  
> When I hear the beat  
> My spirit's on me like a live-wire  
> A thousand horses running wild  
> In a city on fire
> <br/>  
> But it starts in your feet, then it goes to your head  
> And, if you can't feel it, then the roots are dead  
> And if you're the judge, then what is our crime?  
> Here comes the night time

Or in “City With No Children” where the young rebel starts to wonder if he is slowly becoming the establishment:

> You never trust a millionaire  
> Quoting the sermon on the mount  
> I used to think I was not like them  
> But I'm beginning to have my doubts  
> My doubts about it
> <br/>  
> When you're hiding underground  
> The rain can't get you wet  
> Do you think your righteousness  
> Can pay the interest on your debt?  
> I have my doubts about it

The rock is strong, the band is large, the music sometimes cacophonous, always intense, always pulsating with a righteous intensity.

_The Suburbs_ was nominated for Best Album of the Year at the 2011 Grammy Awards. I remember the currents in my Twitter stream from those of us who knew and loved the band. They were up against Eminem, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Lady Antebellum… there was no way they could win. Was there?

Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson announced the award and clearly had no idea, reading the award card, whether _The Suburbs_ was the name of the band or the album. But there it was, Album of the Year.

The band had been backstage, getting ready to play a song to close the show. They came out, accepted their Grammy, then Win set it down on his amp [and away they went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rqvlMuoGRc) with “Ready to Start”. Always live, always real, always ready to play.

In 2014 they went on tour with their new album _Reflektor_. The novelty for that tour was asking fans to dress up (think evening wear) to attend the show. One week in the fall of 2013, before the album released, I was on a work trip in Montreal and they announced a show at a small club nearby the hotel I was staying at. With only a $10 entry fee. I chose that night to go eat dinner with my co-workers rather than stand in line for a chance to get into the show. I’ve never forgiven myself for that decision. I finally saw them on that tour later in the year at the Target Center in Minneapolis. It was the first and likely last time I’ll ever wear a necktie to a rock concert.

Last week Arcade Fire released _WE_, their first new record in five years, and their first good one in nine years. (Can we just pretend _Everything Now_ didn’t happen?) Where _The Suburbs_ captured the frustration of 30-somethings realizing the unescapable strictures of the modern world, _WE_ expresses the resistant hope of 40-somethings coming through the COVID era. _The Suburbs_ Arcade Fire were parents of small children; the _WE_ Arcade Fire now see their kids growing up and leaving.

> Lookout kid, trust your heart  
> You don't have to play the part they wrote for you  
> Just be true  
> There are things that you could do  
> That no one else on earth could ever do  
> But I can't teach you, I can't teach it to you

In “The Lightning I”, the strain of the past decade weighs heavily:

> We can make it if you don't quit on me  
> I won't quit on you  
> Don’t quit on me  
> We can make it, baby  
> Please don't quit on me  
> I won't quit on you  
> Don't quit on me  
> I never quit on you

This seamlessly transitions into “The Lightning II”, which brings a weary hope to the middle of tired frustration.

> I heard the thunder and I thought it was the answer  
> But I find I got the question wrong  
> I was trying to run away, but a voice told me to stay  
> And put the feeling in a song
> 
> A day, a week, a month, a year  
> A day, a week, a month, a year  
> Every second brings me here
> 
> Waiting on the lightning  
> Waiting on the lightning  
> Waiting on the light  
> What will the light bring?

Once again my heart resonates with an artist. . Waiting on the lightning, yes. Hopeful that it will come. And yet shaken enough from the past 5 years of madness to have to ask the question - what will the light bring?
