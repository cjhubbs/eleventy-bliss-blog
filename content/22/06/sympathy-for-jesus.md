It had been a long time since I’d listened to this song. Then it came across my playlist this morning. Don Chaffer of Waterdeep in some strange alter ego called [The Khrusty Brothers](https://www.waterdeep.com/the-khrusty-brothers-lyrics), with his own perspective on being angry at God…

> I came stumbling into church with a hot gun in my hands  
> I was ready to talk to Jesus to tell him my demands  
> But Jesus ain't no fool He's seen this kinda thing before  
> And He had a couple angels stop me at the front door  
> I said “now come on that ain't fair You should be accessible to all”  
> He said “everybody gets a secretary even just to take their calls”  
> “So address me to my face If you think you've got the balls  
> But I ain't playin' around  boy, at all”
> <br/>  
> This was not what I expected, so I stiffened in my stance  
> And I tried hard to remember every single shitty circumstance  
> Then I quivered like a victim with his predator in sight  
> I was ready now to vindicate, I was ready to start a fight  
> Now you can stand right there and judge me  
> Shoot, you can send me straight to hell  
> I know you got the power I know that fact full well  
> But before you do explain to me  
> Why suffering and why death?  
> And why did I pray all those years  
> And waste all that good breath?
> <br/>    
> Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
> Well the angels sang it under their breath by the door  
> Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
> I give up, I can't go on like this any more
> <br/>  
> “Well I appreciate your kind”, he said and then Jesus poured a drink  
> My face musta looked funny cause he said, “It's not like you think”  
> “I'm saddled with the job you know of interpreting my Dad  
> To a bunch of frightened people, frightened or just mad  
> And most of 'em think they got it right” (and then he threw some ice cubes in)  
> “But most of 'em are just dead wrong about life and death and sin  
> And then I got my fiancée, she's supposed to speak my mind  
> But sometimes she's just chicken and then she messes it up other times…”
> <br/>
