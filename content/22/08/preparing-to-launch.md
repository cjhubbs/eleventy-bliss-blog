Eighteen years and seventeen days ago we brought our first child home for the first time. She was just a tiny newborn joining two new, na√Øve parents in the adventure of life.

Tomorrow, we load her packed boxes of belongings into the van and head out to launch her into the next phase of her adventure: college at [SDSMT](https://www.sdsmt.edu/). I'm sure none of us really appreciate yet how much we will miss her, but we're so excited for the opportunity she has and the path that lies ahead of her.

Some days have seemed long, but the time now seems to have been very short.
