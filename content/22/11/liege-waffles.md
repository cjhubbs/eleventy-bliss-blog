On my work trip to Brussels last week I was introduced to the [liège waffle](https://tastecooking.com/waffle-town/), a type of waffle that is denser and sweeter than the common “Belgian waffle” that I’m used to in the States. They were delicious! So when I got home there was no possible option but to find a recipe and try making them myself.

When you go search through the multitude of online recipies for liège waffles, you find that the secret ingredient for these things is [pearl sugar](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-pearl-sugar-5202956) — a compressed form of sugar bits smaller than sugar cubes, roughly the size of mini M&Ms. So, I ordered some from Amazon, printed off [this recipe](https://bakerbettie.com/real-belgian-liege-waffles/), and got to work.

With liège waffles you don’t really have a waffle _batter_ - it’s more a waffle _dough._ It’s sort of a brioche, more similar to cinnamon roll dough that I’ve made than to pancake batter. Threw it all in to the KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook and kneaded it for 5 minutes, then threw it into a warm oven to let it rise for an hour.

Once the dough has risen you knead in the pearl sugar, which gives you a strange mound of dough that crunches when you cut it up into pieces.

Throw these guys into the waffle maker and they cook up very nicely! I used a medium heat that turned out to be just right to caramelize the sugar, giving the waffles a nice shine and a nice crisp surface.

The caramelization is, of course, a little more work to clean up…

Might scale the pearl sugar back by about 20% next time but otherwise this recipe was great! Not quite to the level I got from the pros in Belgium but for sure a good Saturday morning breakfast. These were a hit with the family and we will definitely be making them again.
