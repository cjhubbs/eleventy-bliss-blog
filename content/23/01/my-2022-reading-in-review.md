Another year full of books! (Previous summaries: [2021](/2022/01/my-2021-reading-in-review/), [2020](/2021/01/2020-reading-in-review/), [2019](/2020/01/2019-reading-in-review/), [2018](/2019/01/my-2018-reading-in-review/), [2017](/2018/01/my-2017-reading-in-review/), 2016, [2015](/2016/01/my-2015-reading-year-in-review/), [2014](/2015/01/my-2014-reading-in-review/), 2013, [2012](/2012/12/my-2012-reading/), [2011](/2012/01/my-2011-reading/), 2010, 2009, [2008](/2009/01/2008-a-year-of-reading-in-review/), [2007](/2008/01/2007-in-books-chriss-reading-in-review/)... argh, how did I miss some of those years?)

I got through 61 books this year, which feels like a bit of a down year. My "one book at a time" practice got me bogged down in some slow theology books, and then I got sucked into a cross-stitch project and a couple web projects at the end of the year which stole some of my reading time. (I finally came to grips with breaking up the long theology slogs with some fiction, and that helps a lot.)

Here's the full list of reading, with particular standouts noted in bold:

## Theology

- _Heavy Burdens: Seven Ways LGBTQ Christians Experience Harm in the Church_ - Bridget Eileen Rivera
- _Happiness and Contemplation_ - Josef Pieper
- _The Aryan Jesus_ - Susannah Heschel
- _The Joy of Being Wrong_ - James Alison
- _Attached to God: A Practical Guide to Deeper Spiritual Experience_ - Krispin Mayfield
- **_The Emergent Christ_ - Ilia Delio**
- _The Beatitudes Through the Ages_ - Rebekah Ann Eklund
- _Let the Light In: Healing from Distorted Images of God_ - Colin McCartney
- _In: Incarnation and Inclusion, Abba and Lamb_ - Brad Jersak

- _A Thicker Jesus_ - Glen Harold Stassen
- _Changing Our Mind_ - David P. Gushee

Dr. Ilia Delio's _The Emergent Christ_ is the one that had me thinking the most this year, and that will stick with me longer than any of the others. Her approach to thinking about God, evolution, and universal progress within a Christian framework blew my mind, and consistently challenges me to think about God and the universe differently.

Three women's books stand out here: Tara Isabella Burton's _Strange Rites_, looking at how the current generation of young people are looking for religious experiences in places other than traditional religion; Cole Arthur Riley's spiritual memoir _This Here Flesh_, and Arlie Russell Hochschild's _Strangers in Their Own Land_, describing a sociologist's quest to understand Louisianans who have been devastatingly impacted by environmental destruction and yet persistently support the businesses and political causes behind that destruction.

## Fiction

Here the standout was author Becky Chambers. Her little Monk & Robot novellas sucked me in and made me happy. That prompted me to purchase her Small Angry Planet series and start in on a re-read. Chambers works in the best tradition of science fiction pushing for inclusion and acceptance of The Other and in using the exploration of a very different universe to make you think about how our own could be improved.

## Coming Up...

I've continued to log on Goodreads this past year but I get the feeling it's spooling down as it gets absorbed by Amazon. I'm working on a self-hosted book logging site - it's actually live online right now if you know where to look but I'm going to do some cleanup on it before I publicize it. I'll post here about it when I do!
