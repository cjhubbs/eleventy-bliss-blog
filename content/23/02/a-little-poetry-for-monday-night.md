I’ve done a lot of reading so far this year. Tonight I started _My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer_ by Christian Wiman. I’m not too far in but the writing (prose, punctuated with poetry) is dense and profound.

In the opening chapter he drops this little poem that resounds with truth in my ears. I leave it here for you as a gift.

> Into the instant’s bliss never came one soul  
> Whose soul was not possessed by Christ,  
> Even in the eons Christ was not.
> <br>  
> And still: some who cry the name of Christ  
> Live more remote from love  
> Than some who cry to a void they cannot name.
> <br>  
> -- ‘After Dante’, Christian Wiman
