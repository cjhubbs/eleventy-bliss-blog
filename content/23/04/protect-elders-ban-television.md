danah boyd has [a _fantastic_ piece](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2023/04/10/protect-elders-ban-television.html) out today about the current furor to ban teens from social media, saying basically that (a) it's complicated, and (b) it's more about control than it is helping teens. A brief taste:

> Does social media *cause* mental health problems? Or is it where mental health problems become visible? I can guarantee you that there are examples of both. But here’s the thing…. Going to school and church are often a “cause” of mental health duress. Parents and siblings are often a source of mental health duress. No one in their right mind would argue that we need to prevent all youth from attending school or church or living with their parents or siblings. We take a more tempered approach because there are also very real situations in which we need to remove *some* children from *some* environments (namely abusive ones).
>
> So why do we want to remove ALL children from social media?
>
> This is a story of control, not a story of protecting the well-being of children.

danah is one of the foremost voices to listen to these days regarding the social impact of technology, particularly its impact on teenagers. This reminds me I should go read [her most recent book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300166311/apophenia-20), too.
