In the past two weeks I've logged 13,000 miles in airplanes, 1500 miles in the car, and spent 9 nights out of 13 across four hotels and an Airbus A330 business class seat. I visited KÃ¶ln, Germany and Washington, DC for work, and then road tripped to Rapid City, South Dakota, to pick up my oldest daughter from college.

Maybe sometimes travel is glamorous, but most of the time it's just travel. It's sure good to be home.
