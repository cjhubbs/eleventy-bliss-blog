"You've got a fast car, I want a ticket to anywhere..."

If you've been a pop music fan at some point in the last 35 years, you're probably now hearing an acoustic guitar riff in your head. Tracy Chapman's song Fast Car came out in 1988 and was a Top 10 hit. It's a wonderful song.

I heard Fast Car for the first time about 3 months ago when a social media post linking to a YouTube of Chapman playing the song in front of a restless crowd at Wembley Stadium came across my feed.

I listened to it, mostly impressed at a 24-year-old enthralling a huge crowd with nothing but an acoustic guitar and a microphone. I was probably doing something else at my desk at the time, and didn't really listen to the words.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when my wife and I were out for a weekend and had dinner on a bar patio listening to a guy play acoustic covers. He played Fast Car. I mentioned to my wife that I'd never really heard the song before a month or two ago. She was incredulous. "You don't know this song?" It's about that time in any such conversation that my insecurity and shame creeps in.

I grew up in a fundamentalist homeschooling household where we weren't allowed to listen to "secular music". Classical was OK, and the Christian radio station was fine when it played softer stuff (and tolerated when it played "rockier" stuff), but other than that, nope. By the time I was 17 or 18 and had my own car I could turn on whatever radio station I wanted, but by that time the legalism was pretty well engrained in my young soul and my only comfortable dalliance with "secular music" was the old-time country music I played on the piano as part of the impromptu band at Rinky Tink's ice cream shop during open mic nights.

If you're my age (mid-40s), all that music you grew up hearing in the late 80s and early 90s? I know none of it. Michael Jackson may as well not exist for me. I was scandalized by my cousin's U2 _Achtung Baby_ poster, both because it was a "secular" rock band (joke's on me: they're probably the most Christian rock band of the last 40 years) and because it had the word "baby" on the poster, which undoubtedly referred to some girl they were interested in, and being interested in girls was wrong until you were old enough to get married.

I was a lonely 12-year-old, and 13-year-old, and heck was just without friends and pretty lonely for a lot of my teenage years. I was 12 years old and desperate enough for help that I called in to donate my own hard-earned funds to the Christian radio pledge drive when the reward premium was Charles Stanley's book _How to Handle Adversity_. I anxiously waited for the book to show up, convinced it'd have answers for me. When it finally did, I read what the good reverend from Atlanta suggested: 1) Pray. (Check, been doing that lots.) 2) Lean on friends for support. Well... shit.

I still looked to music to soothe my soul, but the music I listened to as that angsty just-barely-a-teen was music that told me everything would be OK and you shouldn't really feel sad because God. (Glad's song Be Ye Glad and Steve Camp's Love That Will Not Let Me Go come to mind.) There was eventually some CCM music that hinted at it being OK to be angsty - Michael W Smith sang Emily ("on the wire/balancing your dreams/hoping ends will meet their means/but you feel alone/uninspired/but does it help you to/know that I believe in you?") and then later on a duet with Amy Grant on Somewhere, Somehow ("somehow far beyond today/I will find a way to find you") - but I felt ashamed to listen to them and feel that way. (They're still guilty pleasures.)

I signed up for Columbia House Music Club when I was 17 and somehow snuck in a Bryan Adams best of CD. I presume I only knew his name because his Everything I Do (I Do It For You) song was a big enough hit it got played at my (apparently not quite so fundamentalist but still fundy enough we sang Christianized lyrics to Friends in Low Places in chapel) summer camp. Adams' songs rocked (which I loved) but shocked me and had me feeling bad about listening to them. OK, a song like Kids Wanna Rock was ok because it was just about restless kids. But Run To You was about... sex. We can't be talking about that, now. Nope. Skip the track.

It took me well into my 20s to finally let myself listen more broadly to "secular" music, my fundamentalist self surprised to find that Bono was a Christian and U2 was singing amazing stuff, that Win Butler was wrestling with his own spiritual ghosts in his songs for Arcade Fire, that it was OK to just enjoy music that wasn't written about God because it was good music. And in some ways it was fun to have so much music backlog to discover, since aside from Simon and Garfunkel I didn't really know much of anything of pop music.

But it also means that, for a music guy, I've got these big gaps of music knowledge that I'm ashamed of. I try to soak in as much information as I can so I don't appear to be uninformed, but that faÃ§ade only lasts so long.

Part of me doesn't really want to hit publish on this post, because eventually my Dad will read it, and he'll apologize again. As he's realized the past couple years how much damage that fundamentalism did to all of us he's been really broken by it, and apologized over and over. I've forgiven him. I'm a dad, too, and have already had to apologize to my kids for the damage that kind of Christianity did to them before I came to my own realization. (I am glad, though, that they've grown up with Coldplay and Adele and Arcade Fire and then felt the freedom to find their own music regardless of what genre label it falls under. We're slowly undoing that mess.) But aside from guilt and forgiveness, I am finding that to start to heal I have to acknowledge the pain of that teenage boy. It was real. It shaped who I am today in a ton of ways.

> Lyrics from Fast Car by Tracy Chapman

13-year-old Chris would've felt every word of this song. Would've felt less alone, knowing that other people experienced the same ache. But Chris didn't get to listen to that song when he was 13. And Chris didn't stop and really listen to this song until this morning. Which is why 46-year-old grown man Chris is sitting at his desk this morning in tears, listening to Fast Car on repeat.
