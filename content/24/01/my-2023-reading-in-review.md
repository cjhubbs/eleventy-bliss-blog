Another year full of books! (Previous summaries: [2022](/23/01/my-2022-reading-in-review/), [2021](/22/01/my-2021-reading-in-review/), [2020](/21/01/2020-reading-in-review/), [2019](/20/01/2019-reading-in-review/), [2018](/19/01/my-2018-reading-in-review/), [2017](/18/01/my-2017-reading-in-review/), 2016, [2015](/16/01/my-2015-reading-year-in-review/), [2014](/15/01/my-2014-reading-in-review/), 2013, [2012](/12/12/my-2012-reading/), [2011](/12/01/my-2011-reading/), 2010, 2009, [2008](/09/01/2008-a-year-of-reading-in-review/), [2007](/08/01/2007-in-books-chriss-reading-in-review/)...

I read 72 books for the year, which feels like a nice even number. There's still a lot of theology and science fiction in the list, but I read more science this year, along with several memoirs.

Here's the full list of reading, with particular standouts noted in bold:

## Theology

- _Out of the Embers: Faith After the Great Deconstruction_ by Bradley Jersak
- _On the Soul and the Resurrection_ by St. Gregory of Nyssa
- _Reparations: A Christian Call for Repentance and Repair_ by Duke L. Kwon

Green is wonderful here. I [posted](/23/02/chris-e-w-green-on-vocation/) [a few](/23/02/chris-e-w-green-on-christians-as-a-temple/) [excerpts](/23/02/chris-e-w-green-on-the-beatitudes-and-power/) while reading it that would be a good introduction.

I [posted some appreciation for Stewart](/23/10/in-praise-of-humble-gentle-men/) before I got my hands on his memoir. The memoir did not disappoint. He's an imperfect, lovely man. The book was a pleasure to read. Also, he's a great example of why we need funding for arts and arts education. But I digress.
