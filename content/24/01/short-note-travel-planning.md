I have found myself, since returning home from Washington, DC in mid-December, without any travel on my calendar. Normally I travel a half-dozen times per year for work, meaning usually at any given point I've got _something_ at least on the calendar. But right now? Nope.

That _may_ be changing here in the next week or two, with a new possible travel destination for me: York, UK. Somehow I've been to Europe 8 or 9 times but never to the UK. I'd be happy to add it to my list!
