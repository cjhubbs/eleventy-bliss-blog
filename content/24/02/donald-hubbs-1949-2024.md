Donald Bruce “Don” Hubbs, 74, died Saturday at his home in rural Richland County after a nearly two year battle with brain cancer. Don was born November 15, 1949 in Ellsworth, Kansas, to Lloyd and Marge (Stepp) Hubbs. He grew up in small towns in Kansas and Nebraska before attending Nebraska Wesleyan University and the University of Nebraska, where he received a MA in Music Education. In college he met his future wife, Marjorie Jones, and as school teachers making the most of Christmas break, they were married the day after Christmas, 1971. Don taught high school music for several years before eventually taking up piano tuning and repair, the career he would maintain until his retirement. Later in life he accepted a role in public service as the town clerk for the tiny township he called home, taking up the thankless responsibilities of budget and elections because they needed doing, and needed doing well.

Don’s love and concern for people came through in every situation. He loved meeting and chatting with new acquaintances and old friends; at more than one church he was given a key to the door so he could lock up once he was done chatting after the service. He enjoyed working with his hands, frequently making or building solutions when time was more available than money. He taught his children the value of hard work, faithfulness, and consistency through his example. If music was playing, you would frequently catch him conducting along with it. He passed his love of music on to his children, too; everyone learned at least one instrument and sang. When he had time to relax, Don loved fishing, reading, and listening to classical and jazz music.

During the last few years of his life Don had a fresh enthusiasm in his Christian faith as he explored what he described as the actual “good news” of the Gospel, which he distilled down to seven words: “Fear not. In Christ, God is Love.”

Don is survived by his wife of 52 years, Marj; five children: sons Chris (Becky) of Hiawatha, IA, Ryan of Seattle, WA, Aaron (Emily) of Wonewoc, WI, Andrew (Heather) of Cashmere, WA, and daughter Rebecca (Joel) Grette, of East Wenatchee, Wa, his mother Marge, of Springdale AR, sisters Lou(Bob) Maxson of Kearney, NE, and Joy Hubbs of Springfield, MO, brother David (Shelli) of Springdale AR, and eight grandchildren (Laura, Anwyn, Katie, Abigail, Isaiah, Avery, Henry, and Millie). He was preceded in death by his father, Lloyd, and grandson Burke Grette.

A Celebration of Life will be held at Grace Community Church (County Hwy AA) in Richland Center on Wednesday, Feb. 28th . Visitation will be from 10:30-12:00, with a service and time of sharing at noon. A light lunch will be served, and all are encouraged to stay and fellowship. The Clary Memorial Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements.
