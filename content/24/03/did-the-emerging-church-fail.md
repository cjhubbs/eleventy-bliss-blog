Richard Beck has a series going right now in which he asserts that the Emerging Church movement failed. I'm usually pretty aligned with Beck but I'm not so sure this time.

[He defines the Emerging Church](https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/03/why-emerging-church-movement-failed.html) by some familiar characteristics:

- Engagement with post-modernism
- Struggle with evangelical doctrinal positions, leading to epistemic humility
- New awareness of liturgy
- An "aesthetic component", including skinny jeans and a "coffee shop vibe"

That group, [Beck argues](https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/03/why-emerging-church-movement-failed_01434064727.html), "never was able to establish a broad network of churches", and eventually failed because ["evangelism became deconstruction"](https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/03/why-emerging-church-movement-failed_0571666223.html), and, says Beck, "You can't build churches upon deconstruction."

I think Beck is setting up a bit of a straw man here to try to make point he wants to make against deconstruction. But I think there's an alternate history to Beck's that comes to a different conclusion.

I think we can see two developments from the Emergent Church of the early 2000s.

First, It's easy to forget that along with Brian McLaren and Rob Bell, people like Mark Driscoll also came along under the Emergent label. The part of Emergent that went the way of Driscoll took an aggressive posture in their engagement with post-modernism, and rejected epistemic humility, but took up at least some pieces of a new liturgy, and were the exemplars of Beck's skinny jeans-wearing, beer-drinking, coffee shop vibing "aesthetic component". In short order they would reject McLaren and Bell's post-modernism and fall into doctrinal fundamentalism, but they didn't just disappear as Beck asserts.

Second, Beck severely underplays the movement of many in the Emergent Church into mainstream denominations. Rachel Held Evans famously wrote about ["going Episcopal"](https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/going-episcopal). Nadia Bolz Weber is ELCA. Scot McKnight became Anglican. Richard Rohr, a Franciscan monk, is the patron saint of the whole movement. Anecdotally, at the less-famous level, I see a steady stream of exvangelicals deconstructing, embracing epistemic humility, rediscovering the historic liturgy, and embracing a more traditional "aesthetic component" by joining high church mainline traditions.

So did the Emerging Church "fail" as Beck suggests? Maybe, if you construct your definitions as narrowly as he does. But look just a little more broadly and you can trace a path from the Emergent deconstructionists of the early 2000s to the exvangelicals of the 2010s and 2020s and into the pews of the mainline. Whether we will bring the mainline to a resurgence or only forestall its demise by a few more decades remains to be seen.
