Dr. Chris Green [shared part of an essay today](https://cewgreen.substack.com/p/can-god-be-surprised) on a theology of disagreement. There's a ton of good stuff in it. For example, early on:

> Truth be told, what seem to be theological disagreements very often arise from and are borne along by other conflicts rooted deeply in hidden personal and interpersonal anxieties and ambitions. But at least some of our theological disagreements, I want to insist, are in fact the upshot of the Spirit's transforming work taking shape in our as-yet-unperfected lives, moving us toward the "fullness of Christ" in which we find shalom.

This represents a beautiful freedom that I never found in my life in the American evangelical church.

But further, I want to commend to your thinking what he says about orthodoxy. In the evangelical and fundamentalist church, "orthodoxy" tends to be a cudgel used to keep unwanted questions and questioners away, and to scare the flock away from being tempted toward theological ideas that stray from the party line. Green, though, quotes Rowan Williams to suggest a different approach:

> [W]e must reimagine the nature and purpose of orthodoxy. Instead of conceiving of it as a wholly-realized, already-perfected system of thought, we need to recognize it as a fullness of meaning toward which we strive, knowing full well we cannot master it even when in the End we know as we are known. Because the Church's integrity is gift, not achievement, we can never know in advance "what will be drawn out of us by the pressure of Christ's reality, what the full shape of a future orthodoxy might be."

He continues, quoting Williams further:

> Orthodoxy is not a system first and foremost of things you've got to believe, things you've got to tick off, but is a fullness, a richness of understanding. Orthodox is less an attempt just to make sure everybody thinks the same, and more like an attempt to keep Christian language as rich, as comprehensive as possible. Not comprehensive in the sense of getting everything in somehow, but comprehensive in the sense of keeping a vision of the whole universe in God's purpose and action together.

A lot to chew on there, but I love the vision of orthodoxy as a commitment to keeping a vision for God's continuing purpose and action to which we are only slowly understanding. Beautiful stuff.
