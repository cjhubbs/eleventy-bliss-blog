I'm visiting the UK for work this week - my first visit ever. A few thoughts:

- Having a public transit system that seems to work: awesome. I landed at London Heathrow, took a subway, a bus, and a regional train and four hours later had arrived in York, some 200 miles away.
- For my Iowa friends, this would be like flying into Chicago O'Hare and being able to get to Cedar Rapids via public transit. Nifty.
- In-room electric teakettle: delightful, and quick. Why donâ€™t we have them in the US? Oh, because the UK wall voltage is 240v and in the US they would work much more slowly.
- York is a lovely place so far.
- Antique shop here has the same ugly glass display cases that our antique shops in the US have.
- "Antiques" here include tags that say things like 'Roman, probably 400 BC'.
- Felt like the authentic British experience last night when I spent my dinner in a pub next to three guys at the bar who were enjoying after-work pints and arguing about football.
- Assuming my arranged cab shows up in 30 minutes, now I have to go actually do some work.

More later.
