I got to know Mussorgsky's _Pictures at an Exhibition_ when I was in high school and my piano teacher assigned me _The Gnome_. I never got it mastered as much as I wanted, but it was such a fun suite to hack my way through. I listened to the orchestral version of it, and love the gong at the end, but overall I still prefer the piano version.

This video, though, has me reconsidering my opinion. Guitarist Kazuhito Yamashita has arranged the entire _Pictures_ suite for guitar and it is _amazing_. He has captured both the feel and almost all the notes from the piano version. He varies playing techniques to create lovely textures of sound. And while I'm not up on all the modern classical guitarists, I think it's safe to say that Yamashita has amazing skill.
