> Jeremiah 17:9, NKJV

I had someone play the Jeremiah 17:9 card on me the other day. We were winding up a long email conversation wherein I finally was able to make clear that the standard evangelical hermeneutical approach to the Scriptures isn't particularly appealing to me any more - that there are other approaches I find more compelling. (Brian Zahnd's post [Jesus Is What God Has To Say](https://brianzahnd.com/2015/02/jesus-god-say/) captures it pretty well for me right now at a high level.)

Once I got that message across, the message from my conversation partner was simple: beware your motives and understanding, because, after all, the heart is deceitful above all things!

In the evangelical circles I've spent my life in, Jeremiah 17:9 is used as a sort of ultimate trump card. If a discussion starts to go sideways, if someone comes to a logical conclusion that something they've been taught just _can't_ be correct, if someone questions how God could possibly be in the right for, say, ordering the murder of innocent children, this is the fallback. _Of course your heart rebels against that thought. Your heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked! You need to accept that what we are teaching you is correct and ignore any prompting inside you that says otherwise!_

There are problems, thought, with the Jeremiah 17:9 card.

### Logical Coherence

First: playing the Jeremiah 17:9 card is logically incoherent. How did the card player become convinced of the rightness of their position in the first place? Undoubtedly through some combination of study, reasoning, and [internal desire](https://aeon.co/ideas/philosophical-intuition-just-what-is-a-priori-justification) (even if subconscious) to hold that position. So how does the card player know that it isn't _his own_ heart that is deceiving him rather than yours deceiving you? If our heart (i.e. our reasoning as supplemented and powered by our instincts) is deceitful, what basis do you have for claiming that yours is so much _less_ deceitful than mine that your conclusion is right and mine is wrong?

### Other Bible Verses

I don't recommend pulling single verses from their context and using them to justify positions. It's a bad way to understand the Bible. But if you're going to play that game, there is a broad selection of other verses about the heart that might provide an alternative perspective to Jeremiah 17:9.

_Proverbs 4:23: "Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it."_ - This sounds like your heart has something _good_ in it that needs to be protected!

_Psalm 51:10: "Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."_ - The psalmist sure seems to think that purity of heart is a goal worth asking for and attaining to.

_Proverbs 3:3: "Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart."_ - We can have love and faithfulness written on our heart!

_Ezekiel 36:26: "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh."_ - If God gives me a new heart and a new spirit, maybe that new heart is good?

_2 Corinthians 9:7: "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."_ - This one is kinda fun... decide in your heart what to give! God will be happy with this!

_Psalm 119:11: "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you."_ - This one speaks directly to the effects of discipleship upon the heart - the heart is improved and the result is less sinning!

_Hebrews 3:12: "See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God."_ - The existence of a "sinful, unbelieving heart" implies the existence of a holy, believing heart that is turned toward God.

_Proverbs 23:15: "My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad indeed."_ - Solomon suggests that a heart can be wise!

I hope the point here is clear - if you want to play the game of cherry picking to proof-text your point, why is the Jeremiah 17:9 card a more valid and applicable cherry than any of these verses?

### Potential for Gaslighting and Abuse

[Gaslighting](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/sex-relationships/what-is-gaslighting) is a strategy in which a perpetrator bends another person's sense of reality and belief system, making that person second-guess themselves in a way that is beneficial to the perpetrator. [Typical gaslighting phrases](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/sex-relationships/gaslighting-examples) include things like this:

- "Do you really think I'd make that up?"

- "I did that because I love you."

- "You're too sensitive."

- "It's not that bad. Other people have it much worse."

- "I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this."

It's not hard to see how "the heart is deceitful above all things" could fit right in to a gaslighting strategy. A spiritual leader abuses a person in some way. That person responds with a concern. _This doesn't feel right. Something is off here._ The leader points right to Jeremiah. _Your heart is deceitful and desperately wicked. Don't trust it._ And the abuse continues as the victim is further confused between the truth of the matter clear to their conscience and the deception and malpractice of their abuser.

## Finally

A robust examination of discernment - how it works, how we integrate our instinctual "gut feelings", how we experience the influence of the Holy Spirit, how we come to understand God's Word and leading through the wisdom of community - would require far more words than I could write here. Whatever discernment is, though, it's certainly not so simply summed up as "your heart is deceitful, don't trust it".

Instead of living in a constant spirit of fear, Christians should live in a spirit of confidence that God is guiding them. If you've made it this far, you'll forgive me one proof-text for this that also suggests God wants us to use our minds, too.

> For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

> 2 Timothy 1:7, NKJV
