We have attended an Episcopal church now for a few months, enough times at least to get sucked into volunteering for small roles on a Sunday morning. A month ago Becky and I served as greeters/ushers for the service, which she noted might be the first time we've ever signed up for a service task that we did _together_. (Usually I'm the musician and she's working in the kitchen somewhere.)

Then a couple weeks ago I did the musician thing and played the piano for a service. But we have a regular pianist on the payroll who's not me (which is a good thing!) so this upcoming Sunday I'm trying something else: I'm gonna be a reader.

I have been assigned the Old Testament reading and the Psalm. I will be practicing ahead of time so that we can avoid any "banana" moments.
